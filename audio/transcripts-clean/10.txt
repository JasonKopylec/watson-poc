this is world business report from the BBC world service I'm Susanna's Theresa five years on have lessons being learned from the Fukushima nuclear disaster sometimes good things come from bad things and my hope is that Fukushima will change the way nuclear power plants are run around the world untangling the law in the event of break says companies Mull over the legal implications of Britain leaving the year you have to remember we've spent forty years as part of the European union and the full forty years harmonizing our two legal system so if he's going to be a very complex process and the latest twist in the cyber heist at the New York federal reserve one of the hackers mis typed a word and say right foundations of foundation at that point discovery was made that the money was going to sources that were not verified that's all coming up but fast uhhuh dnmt nndb remembering the victims of the devastating prime minister Shinzo Abby that the ceremony in Tokyo hit not the moment five years ago when the huge trauma unleashed a torrent of wolves which devastated Japan's northeast coast eighteen thousand people died in today more than a hundred and seventy thousand people still remain in temporary accommodation the tsunami also crippled a nuclear plant kushina web meltdowns in three reactors spread radiation over a wide area contamination Borsa whose and at well because from the energy company tapco observed a minute's silence the plot the company's president Sammy carols told them it would not forget how its own safety procedures being at fault not meeting up there it's all going to be no I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the tsunami smashed and swept away the over confidence and arrogance technical today five years on we need to face that fact once again and I would like to reaffirm his determination with you that we take responsibility for the Fukushima accident and that's ok though organist at the moment well during the disaster safety systems at the Fukushima plant when knocks out and radioactive material was released into the air and into the state it was the worst nuclear accident in a quarter of a century and indeed one of the worst in history so what lasting effect has it had on the nuclear power industry a correspondent Thier legates has been finding out after the earthquake and tsunami Japan now has to cope with the big explosion at a nuclear power station the Japanese government has warned of a possible nuclear meltdown in another reactor as an art I believe that there is a possibility that Milton has occurred it is inside the reactor we all already products are actually uncovered the emanation raise review it shouldn't have happened but it did the Fukushima Daiichi plant was designed to withstand a severe earthquake and when it struck the reactors did indeed shut down safely but they still needed cooling and then came the fourteen needs a tsunami which engulfed the clan to knock out it's cooling systems the reactor cores overheated and melted and explosions and radioactive material spewing into the air five years later more than a thousand square kilometers of land around the plant remain off limits according to professor Toshiya Tsuda of Akiyama university that being serious health effects especially among young people was a mark and I no onto Littlejohn sludgy New York and Google thing on the thyroid cancer recurrence rates among Fukushima residents who are up to eighteen years of age in the year of the meltdown twenty to fifty times higher than those in other parts of Japan even within Fukushima prefecture the rates vary from place to place the closer location is to the dock she plans the higher the cancer Karen's got sky total orbital or confiscate will I mean the disaster crippled Japan's nuclear industry prior to the accident it had fifty four reactors available producing a third of the country's electricity or was shut down for safety checks and only a handful have since been restarted but the effects haven't just been felt in Japan as Barbara judge a former head of the U. K.'s atomic energy authority and an adviser to the Fukushima plant undetected explains there was going to be a nuclear renaissance in Europe and not only faucet here in the UK but the Italians and the Germans and the Polish and the Hungarians and a whole bunch of European countries for building or renewing their power plants a lot of those countries of pull back from that off difficult shimmer Germany and Switzerland decided to phase out nuclear power altogether even fronts which relies on reactors for three quarters of its electricity has seen its industry suffer because its once thriving export markets have dried up but some experts believe the seeds of this decline were actually sign a quarter of a century the full Fukushima the Soviet Union has admitted that an accident has taken place at a nuclear power station turn a beer in the Ukraine Soviet authorities are telling the world very little about what is happening there but it's clear that a disaster of major proportions has occurred main television use hair analysis two people were killed in the nuclear accident the structure itself was destroyed and the wall speak of reasonable disaster of nineteen eighty six showed just how devastating a nuclear acts could be a radioactive plume contaminated a huge swathe of Europe from Ukraine to Scandinavia according to energy consultant Michael Snyder who opposes nuclear power memories of the accident a shaping attitudes to the industry to this day people forget but that in the UK you had you know sheep farmers that were under restriction orders until two thousand twelve from an accident fifteen hundred kilometers further distance so that left a very profound impression on the European population but although there's relatively little enthusiasm for nuclear power in Europe and North America in other regions it has much stronger support as Peter cannon lead energy analyst at the economist intelligence unit's explains the outlook for nuclear power is quite good especially in China and also in South Korea India and Russia that's money because they raise very fast growth in electricity consumption so these countries need to satisfy that increasing demand for power anyway they can and they'll say see nuclear power as a viable like carbon option but in the end the long term success or failure of the nuclear industry may come down to simple economics the costs of building reactors insuring safety dealing with waste and decommissioning redundant facilities are very high while generating electricity from gas is currently a lot cheaper and ultimately that may prove to be a bigger obstacle to the growth of nuclear power than the legacy the Fukushima when the elegance of course you had briefly from lady Robert judge the former head of the U. case atomic energy authority and an adviser to the board up tempo I interviewed her analyst washing her view was the long term scale of the damage to human health and the environment from the crew Fukushima disaster anybody who says they really know anything about anything it's probably wrong or at least know everything I believe that what's happening in Fukushima now is in the very best and brightest direction I believe that there is a handle on the decommissioning process the government and telco and the other big Japanese companies have banded together to provide the best decommissioning the most modern in do they have to keep inventing things to deal with cleaning up Fukushima with respect to the radiation actually if you talk to doctors I brought a woman named Jerry Thomas whose radiation specialists from imperial college I brought her to go to Fukushima to see what was going on there and from the radiation specialists they all believe that that actually Fukushima when it's cleaned up will be fine it's just like any of the other decommission plans that wheat with ridiculously Haro right here the fact is it's taken a long time but they're on the right road now there a lot of foreign experts coming in to help the Japanese into the whole world a nuclear community is focused on making sure the best possibly can be done to Fukushima will be and my own opinion I think we we will at this point find that the radiation damage is whatever there was and remember nobody die from radiation in Fukushima they certainly were problems in moving the people away from it but not actual radiation I think at this point it's on the very right wrote but efforts and money and training and time will continue to be needed for a long time so what lessons have been learned to think a lot a lot of lessons have been learned from Fukushima first of all what's learned is that every nuclear power plant needs a safety culture a very strong safety felt every nuclear power plant needs an independent regulator and there has to be a regulatory tension the regulator can't be too friendly with the operators they have to feel that there's a real when I call regulatory attention there has to be continual checks of what the equipment's doing people have to think the unthinkable left I mean in terms of Fukushima member twenty thousand people died from the earthquake but the power plants stayed up after the earthquake it was the tsunami that came and knocked out the back up systems which turned out the lights which meant everybody was operating in the dark and then there was actually no system of crisis control at the time today we know that when there's a crisis one person in the plant makes the decision I think that sometimes it's horrible to service but sometimes good things come from bad things you know in my opinion the whole world has learned a lot of lesson about the operation of nuclear power plants I was an SEC commissioner yes he was set up because we had the terrible depression in nineteen twenty nine in the stock market crash in America and a lot stock market crashes because they were really bad dealings going on in the markets thats why they set up the SEC the FCC has made the American markets wide and deep for many years regulation in the city of London really started with Maxwell crisis Maxwell was not a gentleman like the London people who'd been in the city before thoughts when good regulation started lots of things that are really unfortunate end up having some good consequences and my hope is the Fukushima will change the way nuclear power plants are run around the world lady Barbara judge that two heavyweight British political figures of wages into the debate today about whether Britain should leave the European Union has first major speech since openly backing brexit London map hours Johnson has that leaving the EU is a win win claiming the UK could thrive and prosper as never before but the former prime minister Tony Blair told campaign it's for Britain to stay in the European Union to make the case with passion saying it's the UK's destiny to lead in Europe away from the sound bites on the campaign trail businesses large and small contemplating two very different futures both with uncertainty attached one huge question a grappling with is just how difficult it might be to unpack legislation which originates from Europe but is now enshrined in you can't know David hall is a partner from the international November just Hammond who advises corporate firms on domestic and international disputes he told me that it would not be easy you have to remember we spent forty years as part of the European Union Honda for forty years harmonizing our two legal systems under the laws that we have and so if he's going to be a very complex process to do that will work on various levels of the first things will have to do is that the big thing of having given notice to come out of the European you we will have to negotiate the continued relationship and integration between our legal system because just because we **** three European Union doesn't mean that we don't have a need to understand with our close trading partners how altitude ecosystems would work together this huge raft of peer legislation that ready governs how the UK operates there's a difference that was in that between European regulations and European directives yes strikes a regulation is something which has a direct effect into English school what that means is that we don't need any further English as a selection to make it have affect in the UK a directive however is a pronouncement all of the things that the European Union wants the the member states to bring into effect on their own who'll say if there was to be a brexit regulations would essentially disappear overnight we would remove ourselves from those and presumably we would then have to work out which of those actually really all the wounds it and so to workout how we keep the benefit of those regulations and remove those we don't want directives however a little complicated in that they are actually part of UK law and say that was lost would remain and if we didn't like those pits the legislature would have to workout how it Worsley Xie's those from the UK statute book sellers of what the lawyers huge outlook brother Moore with politicians and government put on them and massive button on the government to workout how and what needed to stay I'm what would be to be brought in to replace that which it conference I've got a regulation which is supervised by a body in the new adult body would no longer have jurisdiction to supervise those issues in England so we would have to therefore establish a replacement multi to to look at those things to what extent with this course at a huge headache for big corporations that you already advice yes well it is a it is a headache business thrives on certainty I work comes the long this is one way one to her certainly the rules that govern them in the outcomes of those rules and then they won't have certainty is what will happen if they have a speeds on those rules will they have a a quick and efficient and predictable outcome which they can then enforce top of the to do list will of course be renegotiating those trade agreements but how long could that tape why I think that he's probably the most important beta ultimately the Amy was established for many reasons but for free trade that has been established if we all now voting to remove ourselves from big free trade area we will have to negotiate how is that we can access that territory to address things like tariffs and non tariff based barriers to trade like licensing squashes quantity and that was David ho from budget fan it's time now to take a look at the financial markets and we can speak to bank him off seven investment management hello that bags of the markets is still digesting that move by the European central bank to cut key interest rates and flood the market with more liquidity yes it's it was a bit of a weird one ready now we know yesterday the markets initially rallied strongly on that fell again by the end of the day talking in particular about Europe now today the applicant very strongly taking most of the rest of the world with the so it seems that initially we thought this is everything we've asked for and on further reflection people in the markets thought well we're not quite sure on the details after night digesting the details it seems that in fact Mr trophy house delivered the kind of stimulus that everybody wanted so pretty buoyant ready for the markets overall would you say yeah I think so European banks reps exit off percent today Europe the rest of Europe is up about three and a half percent it what Mr Draghi has really done is make sure the lending in the eurozone is that was easy as possible for banks to get on board with and he hasn't hurt the interest margin profit margins assistance okay thank you very much Ben Kimmel of seven investments management let me give you some of the latest numbers now from the financial markets and in London the one hundred Sharon Texas up one point seven percent at sixty one forty in New York the Dow is up one point three percent at seventeen thousand two hundred and ten gold is trading at one thousand two hundred and fifty nine dollars an ounce on the currency markets the gear I was at one dollar eleven point eight U. S. sense the pound is that one dollar forty four point one and April New York light crude oil is cut me up eighty three cents at fifty eight point six seven dollars a barrel it's that time of the week now when we can look back at just some of the stories which it made the headlines yeah nnat European central bank has announced new measures to boost the flagging eurozone economy further below zero makes the business models all bonds and insurance unsustainable in carts savers it is unclear died will promote five there are spending stop trump the Republican campaign to derail the property billionaires tilt for the White House the Republican Party as we have understood it free trade polite iffy wasabi party will never be the same if trump is the nominee the central bank in Bangladesh says the packets of stolen and unspecified amount of money from its account at the New York federal reserve we haven't gotten to the bottom of the story all the New York fed is saying is that their systems have not been breached that's doesn't mean there couldn't there hacking from China or somewhere else nnj so did you stop them well as we heard just now in the markets the European central bank has fought off a ministry policy bazooka but just how long will the effects last plus the presidential primary debates in the U. S. protectionism has read it has what would high tariff barriers mean for the American economy and the cyber heist at the New York federal reserve when he did those missing millions go wild to discuss those subjects I speak to Elaine more who's the capital markets correspondent at the Financial Times and London that'll say with Joan bus eight associate editor of the wallstreet journal in New York it warmed markets around the world initially and I think markets began to reflect on the deployment of the bazooka and the continuing concern that a previous fires from various armaments bi drugih I have not ignited the economy in Europe at a certain point psychology says this is an extraordinary measure set of measures that he has taken all stimulative wow this is going to really fire up things in Europe then psychology shifts and says but he must be feeling truly desperate at this stage how bad is it are we underestimating how bad it is LA more is that your take on this and do you think by Draghi signifying that they won't be further cuts that kinda have led to a bit more of a lukewarm reception definitely Sarah trader that I speak to quite regularly said that there was a hush that descended across the floor as soon as Mary drug made that statement about not investing further cuts being made up to that point markets have been rallying so the the stimulus of a program that married Jackie had announced was far more than anyone had been expecting some of the economist I was speaking to you today now that the dust to settle that has said perhaps my doggy is actually trying to influence the real economy so have to think that what they all said it was cut the rate at which banks in Europe Campari money from the ECB so perhaps the focus this time is not on the financial markets but on trying to get the real economy in Europe going how are negative rates views in the United States negatively Europe now joins the gallery of economic rogues and include Japan this is not good company Japan's had Skinner twenty years of economic stagnation viewed as kind of a hail Mary pass an effort to move an economy that has not responded to previous monetary policy and it reminds everybody that there's a lot of structural dislocation of the European economy that needs to be addressed and has not been and if you're a saver etcetera because them to rush out and take that money out of a can spend which would be stimulative it's going to cause them to hunker down even further it's going to cause them to save some concerns raised about policy in Europe but wash about policy puts on the table in the United States John at the presidential primaries protectionism is Brady bread ring it's had isn't it it really is it's wild and woolly and unpredictable what's happening in the American political campaign right now you have Donald Trump the front runner in the Republican contest for the nomination to be president talking about putting up forty five percent tariffs on China if it doesn't behave now what is what is he mean by that and how specific has he been way hazmat specifically we don't know what he means but it is highly protective and it's usually language that you find not on the right but on the left in politics in the United States and yesterday a rich Trumka who's head of the AFL CIO the union of unions said of trump you know even a blind squirrel can find an acorn now and again meaning that he was aligned with trump on his trade policy which is a very unusual in American politics and Elaine on the left it certainly seems now is that Hillary Clinton is playing catch up with Betty Saunders he's Hadda already anti free trade campaign so far it's really interesting the bunnies on as it's been able to use the idea of global trade is something to to hit Hillary Clinton within the fact that she's retreated from her support of the trans Pacific partnership which is heralded as this pivot that U. S. was going to do towards Asia but I think that it does make sense in this point in the elections that the focus is on the domestic economy there's a lot of concerns about the living standard of middle class Americans fatty sort of stagnating and the impact on jobs of global trade the concern for the rest of the world is that the IMF is been saying recently global trade is slowing down and it's a problem and that they won't policymakers to get involved and the U. S. just when people right now Elaine is absolutely right I mean this is catering to a deep concern of the United States that living standards have not been rising for a vast stretch of the electorate odd that has seen their jobs move abroad up or has just been disrupted by the digital economy however it does have an effect on the global economic outlook if the world is looking at negative interest rates in Japan negative interest rates in Europe stagnating economies in both any United States that might be retrenching to its own shores a politically and even if some of that language results in actual policy you'll see further slowdown globally in the economy what about the story about the New York federal reserve and this type a heist which Bangladesh claims is coal states more than a hundred million dollars because he said he seemed early on in the week because they need the site was talking the same story this looks as if it was a hack through the Bangladesh system hackers came in they got passwords they got authorization keys that allow them to behave as if they were the Bangladesh central bank and they moved money out of the federal reserve to other places around the world where they cashed it in so it looks like it came in through Bangladesh but even if it did this raises incredible questions about security of big money flows in the world how was that allowed to happen how was the fed not on top of Bangladesh saying your systems are inadequate how was the the fed not able to verify transactions of that size with central authorities in Bangladesh before they were made this is going to have a lot of repercussions because the money was of such a large amount the point that I think is really incredible is the way that this was found out so it wasn't that either of the central banks was able to spot this it was that one of the hackers mis typed a word and so right foundations and a foundation at that point discovery was made that the money was going to sources that were not verified it's a huge scale of a problem that is happening all over the world right now so I was talking to somebody who said that slot twelve thousand businesses worldwide are estimated to have been hacked by these things with a C. E. O. emails criminals a thought have got about two billion dollars from this you would expect would you John that systems at the New York federal reserve would've been good enough to withstand the as you would expect and I think that of the good work of our colleagues in Europe on reporting this is going to result in a lot of review of how this happened because of it happened for Bangladesh one wonders who else has it happened for in other words not cannot happen again or will it happen again but where has it already happened that we just don't know this just goes to show that biggest intuitions big financial institutions are not impervious two what is it and credible global scourge at this point and that was John Makdessi associate editor of the wallstreet journal in New York and in that discussion with and they know who's capsule markets correspondent at the Financial Times in London that's all for this edition of world business report you can keep in touch by email well don't business at BBC dot co dot UK or on Twitter BBC world base from all of us here thank you for downloading from the BBC world service you can find a whole world of information from science arts business and technology just go to the BBC world service dot com slash pub because
