this is world business report from the BBC world service I'm Suzanne is Theresa the aftermath of the deadly bomb attacks in Brussels just what effect will the attacks have on the region it's going to have serious repercussions all the way through the airlines train operators hoteliers and the millions of people in Europe who work in terrorism security is being stepped up across Europe but more stringent checks at apples will cost more will always be at risk of something new happening the only way around that would be for governments to more of the security operation and they currently do and I really don't see that happening found in Africa we have from firms generating power despite the lack of electricity we have to go and buy food first west I mean we can't have light but we need light so sick when we do more on that entrepreneur in Malawi coming up fineness Brussels is unlocked and following a series of deadly gun attacks two blondes tugs at the apple killing fourteen one med being carried out by a suicide bomber an hour later a bomb in the metro train in central Brussels killed about twenty people witnesses described harrowing scenes of passengers struggling to escape from right carriages that mobile station close to the European Union institutions with the full scale of the attacks emerging the Belgian prime minister shaman shall addressed his nation wouldn't you can also move more I would like to tell you we face a tragic moment a black moment for our country now more than ever I would like to appeal to old to be calm and to show solidarity we are confronted with a child a difficult challenge and we must face it by standing United showing solidarity and staying together also on the dole hustle Brussels is not just the heartache the EU it's also where many diplomatic missions are based on the headquarters of hundreds of international businesses many people had already arrived at work before the attacks took place peace determines is the chief executive of the federation of enterprises in Belgium he told me that workers were staying calm despite the chaotic scenes on the streets good morning of us of course a big surprise but most of people most of employers and their employees who are already in in Brussels so them most important problem that we are dealing with now is how we can get those employees back home this evening because for the moment the stations are closed to met was closed so we are looking for other dissolution Serbia sending messages to our members saying okay look for cooperating or other means to transport your country's Homer this this evening and I suppose the situation has been made more difficult because some phone networks of being blocks yeah well but for network yes were blocked but we can we were advised to communicate via social media what's up the viper a tweeter and so and and of course immediately afterwards our national telecom operators have opened their network to to all people for free and there was also free transportation by Texas in the in the region of Brussels so there was a huge solidarity between between let's say employers the hole on the one hand and please and and on the other hand because it's it was a very very sad day for for us today though absolutely this isn't the first articles that Brussels as being a lockdown after the Paris attack said the city was effectively close for a number of days so you the businesses that you worked with have had experience of that just how difficult is it to do business in a period of lockdown oversee many partners will be understanding but it will radio affect the way that Brussels candy business well into you notice that will be an issue to take over yet another Brussels and Brussels region is especially essay service based economy that means that you can easily have complex via kite be phone video conferences etcetera etcetera that's very much easier to do when the working in and service based economy to admit that in an industrial environment so I think it's it's an issue for Brussels for certain but we can continue to function as before because there are no other means to do so but it will have an impact that that foreshortened but unlike in November we handle it very well and we can we are a pretty resilient economy and there are many many headquarters here in Brussels and we will collaborate in the next issue it is also with the Richmond I'm Chumley American chamber of commerce and the bridges Tim of commerce to see what what yes the best to do it so that we can Sam got some messages to also to those a month in ashes don't fear it stay in Brussels and to do business in Brussels and a bunch of and that was Jesus elements from the federation of enterprises in Belgium well following the blast Facebook activated it safety check feature which allows its users to check on friends in the city airlines have reviews of flights and many hotels across Brussels up also unlocked tab the landmark trump last was deserted with several museums and other top tourist destinations in the city's historic center closed I'll silent colder travel editor at the independent newspaper in the UK just what impact these attacks would have on Europe's travel industry crucially this struck at the departures area of Brussels airport in other words the so called remind side before the security check and you have this bizarre situation where this very intense security and to stop people hijacking or bombing aircraft yet anybody could until this morning wondering to Brussels airport unchecked in fact I was at a at Munich airport just last night it was ridiculous you could just step off the Espanto ran away into the airport area no checks and I was part of a massive queue waiting to get through passport control and security which from a terrorist point of view I'm afraid presents a very tempting target the thing is though you could say that about any big kid around a football stadium outside a nightclub that kind of thing where you draw the line well of course and that that he's serious concern however transport any particular aviation seems to be the chosen arena for terrorists and I think we will see the kind of security that you get in places that have been a long history of terrorism such as Istanbul Nairobi Mumbai all of those airports everybody's checks before they are allowed anywhere near the terminal that's going to happen show our way of life in the west is as it were under attack but there are steps that can be taken and in the meantime the travel industry is just looking at this latest attack and and wondering how it is going to impact and I think on the number of people coming to Europe particularly from areas where starkly people have been sensitive such as North America such as Asia the important Japanese and Chinese markets they might well decide perhaps not to cancel their trips but not necessarily to to to book him for the year the coming summer it's going to have serious repercussions all the way and through the airlines that the train operators hoteliers and the millions of people in Europe who work in terrorism how long does it take for London to bounce back off to the seven seven bombings in two thousand and five it does take a few months I mean that was an awful summer of course I'm in a sense London is different because it is such a huge business center issues such a a vostro it is also better connected than any other city on the planet and so therefore there was a bit more resilience I think places such as Brussels certainly Istanbul will I fear be more badly affected I'm simply because I think these things are also so cumulative as it were prospective travelers will maybe say they'll discount one bond atrocity but then another one comes along and then another and another and it builds up a picture of a world which is profoundly dangerous it isn't I'll be looking at the numbers and travelers globally a safer than they have ever been in history that risks a lower per person that than they've ever been however it certainly doesn't feel like that travel editor Simon colder that well countries across Europe is stepping up security in response in France sixteen hundred extra police will be deployed at key transport hubs Germany and the Netherlands are increasing checks at that borders the head of anti terrorism police in Britain set extra patrols are being deployed as a precaution Newman shanks was head of group security AppleScript PAN is now professor of aviation security at Coventry university in the UK he told me the beefing up security at airports might help but new screening technology wouldn't make much difference sadly the recent search technology available today that's you could screen passengers and their baggage open going through the traditional baggage screening process there is technology around will help you to screener and individual or group of people who may be carrying weapons or devices but we can't see inside bag suburban putting through an xray we couldn't call for a an initial check being carried out the front door all that would do is create congestion and they more attractive target for a different type of bombing or prenatal machine gun attack and the match I was also targets Hayes it would be very difficult to employ such screening technology and a transport hub Lika a railway station or metro witness E. S. from exactly the same problem you have firm areas where you could actually set up a security operation but the danger of that is you are setting up a launch equally unprotected area that some could be exploited by terrorists much more easy to do a drive by shooting or grenade attack then it would be inside the train station itself because what you're doing is you're moving the the target too much less secure area and it appears as if I've the last few years there has been some kind of reluctance among some apple operators to continue with this high level security that we saw introduced since nine eleven in particular do you think that given these most recent attacks any kind of Fatah reticence on behalf of apples will fade away well two reasons for the reticence one is of the cost falls entirely down to the industry the airport operator who passes the cost on to the airline who then passes the costumes of the traveler very few governments actually contributes to the security costs so they are naturally trying to balance the budget in terms of what is an acceptable level of security to make the loans threats so it will always be at risk of something new happening the only way around that would be for governments to funds more of the security operation and they currently do and I really don't see that happening and that was professor aviation security no man shanks that's got an ages now from the financial markets and Brenda Kelly had it analyst at London capital group aides have Brenda was the market reaction in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on the immediate aftermath was around seven o'clock in the morning and that was very much felt that would in the bond market where we saw big capital flow into like the German bond a gold was also at one of the beneficiaries of rose around one percent in the immediate aftermath of the news being released and then once the actual markets themselves opened we saw the real casualties which were really amongst other travel and leisure stocks the likes of easyjet Ryanair IAG Ole under significant pressure we only a couple of local producers actually in the green and the very early part of trade analysts deoxy warrant I we did I see a certain amount of pairing of those losses and while you know they were at one stage down around for a half percent those airline stocks to close the day and down from one to one and a half percent so it does show a certain amount of I suppose that resilience within the stock market and I think investors becoming a little bass and watching Dana possibly tolerant tip to such activities and events and that was a real defensive move ready plowing into gold was other stocks I'll see ms move a safe haven I will oversee gold is that it's a traditional safe haven and of course the likes of the currencies like the Japanese yen the Swiss franc world so very well that bit as well and bullets are really I think the market's actually ended the day up a little bit higher the footsteps echoed slightly higher in the day but again a lot of the actual stocks that were in the game were gaining for the defensive sectors the likes of the healthcare the staple sector like the supermarkets there were no real assertive at risk assets shall we say like growth or our our oil stocks and that were anyway and very much wild bed and of course as I said at the Kaufman leisure industry remained very very much under pressure I would more than likely continue to do so avatar has been the case over the last number of months particularly aftermath powers attacks as well and of course you've had a few I suppose and if you guys said that the French and issue at the airport as well so all of the husband of volatility in those stocks are and in the year to date as well and I believe it was Thomas cook either a major UK travel firm that just one yesterday that it was a very volatile time for travel companies in particular yes it does certainly was quite recent of Thomas cook I but I think this is been something that has been out while flag but nobody hasn't expected to exist satanic degree of what happened in Brussels today and the fact that the airport remains closed and will more than likely remain close for the foreseeable future and what we will more than expected expect assailant volatility until we get a bit more clarity on what's been done about the incident okay Brenda Kelly had analyst at London capital group thanks very much for talking to us that we give you some of the latest numbers now from the financial markets and as Brenda was saying in London the one hundred chant exits up slightly point one percent to sixty one ninety three in New York the Dow is up point one percent at seventeen thousand six hundred and thirty two gold is trading at one thousand two hundred and forty eight dollars an ounce and on the currency markets the euro is that one dollar twelve point one U. S. that you're listening to wild visits reports on the BBC world service the weld radio station and a special good evening to listeners on ninety one point nine FM in Spain's Costa del sol we lays on talk radio your a giant of the technology world just one of the tributes to Andy Grove former CEO of Intel who's died age seventy nine he repelled Intel into becoming a household name in computers anti played a key role in the company shifted focus from memory chips to microprocessors he said his management philosophy of only the paranoid survive was inspired by living and dead **** occupation in Hungary in his youth his interview with him will cost a well business ripples in nineteen ninety five when he predicted a new era attack with a much I believe and actually if you are strongly about that is that the next frontier in the use of these general purpose prosecutors will be to use them for communication tasks specifically real time or live communication tasks sort of like and multimedia telephony people will use them to hold conferences both business conferences and personal social conferences with each other exchanged photographs here each other seeing each other all that click of a mouse on an icon over telephone lines I think he's got a new frontier for computing they can do it now but it's difficult ID have to modify the computers to do it now like so many other things forces multimedia the phenomenon takes off when the scalability comes built into every computer that you buy subject is there for you to use it and this will be something different from telephoning all using the internet as people use it at the moment will it it will be different from telephones in that it will be visual it will be multimedia not just voice it will be different from the internet which is multimedia or the worldwide web is multi media in that it will be live in real time so if you you know way what I'm describing is the best of the two extreme walls of telephony and the worldwide web well it was Andy grows speaking to the BBC's pieces died back in nineteen ninety five pull Sappho is that technology focused are based in Silicon Valley he knew Andy Grove and I asked him how his up bringing in **** occupied Hungary affected access that's a fabulous question that's the first time I've heard that question asked in your you've really put your finger on something very important because success in Silicon Valley requires one to fully into the future just as fast as you can to take nothing for and I think that that's what one learns as a refugee is it you flee into the future if you take nothing for granted and Andy absolutely brought that kind perspective how do you think that was why Intel was able to identify those disruptors in the business and and seize on them and ands and exploit the melee course everything in Silicon Valley is team based and handy was successful because he had such a marvelous partnership with his colleagues at Intel but he's the one who pushed the hardest on saying we have got to push this business hard we have to keep going over the next horizon told identify and exploit the opportunities that others cannot even imagine because Intel could have been left behind ready just delivering chips instead he propelled the company towards micro processing and all that follows when you think about the origins of the personal computer he played an absolutely crucial role because he's the one who pushed Intel to turn microprocessors into a business and look for markets and without that there would have been no personal computer revolution we has a clip earlier in the program of him talking about his vision for the future and he said it would be worn why people would be exchanging photographs and talking to each other in real time over the internet he said using a click of the mouse in fact we've using small bones really to do that but that was over twenty years ago that he may thoughtful costs and it's become true absolutely and a big reason why his vision became true was that he worked very hard to help make it true how would you sum up his contribution to technology he was an extraordinarily well rounded man the phrase renaissance man is yours tripe sounding but very true this is a gentleman who played a key role here developing technology roadmaps and that's what makes him stand out as there lots of people around all those elements but Andy was one of a very small number of people who actually combined all of them into a single person and that was cool Sappho a technology focus it keeps our computers running the phones charged and the lights on but can you imagine running a business without an electricity in many parts of the world that a lack of power is a very real situation for companies all across Africa governments is struggling to connect people to basic and reliable electrical services in Malawi any one in Tamil always has a connection in the rural areas it's about one in a hundred the BBC's Matt McGrath is that when I put it to him that must be very difficult for businesses to cut without electricity for much of the time it is indeed is not just the connection or disconnection from the electricity grid that's the problem it's the infrequency of electricity supplies when you are actually connected to the grid the papers publish lists of shut down power in particular is a show it's cut off and these can range from all four hundred in the morning till two in the afternoon and they've several times we've seen over the last couple days through the night and overnight as well so it's very difficult for businesses to cope with that having said that their love very enterprising people here and there and people are very good at using whatever meager supplies victories that they do guest set any specific examples well a particular example that comes to mind is a somebody we we visited and saw during the week here and that's a charity called solar array to sell a pay as you go solar package which involves a little amp and it's also a phone charger they sell it for about twelve U. S. dollars but they settled on the pay as you go system so that people actually pay down payment in the paid over the next couple months if they don't pay at though the company has that the ability to using the distributor smartphone to turn off the light to cut you off at source so a little earlier I spoke to a brave Mahoney who distributes these particular solar labs and I asked him to explain how it all worked so basically we tell customers how much the lamp cost and ask them to pay all the costs of thirty four months but if you don't pay in a particular month in that I'm goes off but a much carry us how does that work out of a volcanic well how do you how do you control that I'm friends from a distance this is computerized to be honest saw we send all information on the custom in December and then automatically if you pick something with links to the that the amount of blood that you get is a limited amount of money that you pay it's a very advanced technological system solution to something that you kind of think you've got the cart before the horse here in the sense that you have a very advanced technology and computers to give people light is also need to go because whipping we can Manali systems is great and the biggest challenge ever on everybody's do have enough money to pay we have to go and buy food fest west I mean we can't have light but we need so that when we do she'll just focus on a small section of those who can afford not wait Whitley Chevrolet any charges by little solar panel that you touch to hear yes announce a very small and sort of I don't know I don't small tiny isn't an axe but so long and have the title checked up with after the final eight hours he's our guests included so what you wrote him during the day you leave us at home charges up and then at the night time you can have a light and also charge a fall so that was brave Mahoney who distributes those solar lights but what the government saying about what they can do the government says it's trying to open up the market for independent power providers they say that they're in talks with about twenty different groups to want to take part in providing private enterprise power if you like and the big difficulty of course is trust and the question of governance couple of years ago another was a big scandal here called cascade from enough of donor aid went missing and since then the donor agencies have kept back their money and that's accounts for about forty percent of the government's budget so there is really a lack of trust on behalf of the international community in the way that the government does things that may be improving but for the businesses who want to come in and set up and provide power the question marks over whether the government can actually meet its promises and conflict support them financially because nobody's going to come in here and provide power for nothing and those still I think remains big obstacles and that was not a crime in Malawi how had it welled business report was celebrating a very special birthday soon with details about how to join in the celebrations he's my colleague Richard callings dnmt nnj move on slicing a Chesney Hawkes we were the one and only an instant hit but was back in nineteen ninety one when will business report was born were you listening to us at the time twenty five years of past since we started will business report on the BBC world service now you can be part of our anniversary celebrations at the beginning of April we'd like you to send in your memories of listening to us back in the early nineteen nineties is there any business story in particular that sticks in your mind the internet as we know it ample cast still hadn't been invented so did you listen to us on short wave send us your memories recorded as an MP three voice filed on either a smartphone or your computer to wilt business at BBC dot co dot UK by the thirty first of March these recording should be no longer than two minutes willing to broadcast the selection of them in another three programs you can also write to us with your memories at the same address just put anniversary in the subject title dnmt that if you get you can keep up to date with us as well on Twitter at BBC well Basil me at Susan St had to find out what stories were chasing and had the audio from you've been listening to world business report from all of us here goodbye
