S. trade embargo still clinging to life as taxis Blanca Rodriguez has been renting out rooms in her house in old Havana for five years Alana a need to suit the mood will sign you know in the past two years tourism has really been booming we've really busy I think that once the news broke about diplomatic ties being restored between the United States and Cuba it led to a huge increase in tourism lots of tourists think that keep is going to change when the relationship with America improves do you think they're right or wrong you don't if Leno in this for us it's kidneys the Americans come and get to know Cuba and for us to get to know American people we have no complaints against sin and we haven't any bad feelings despite all the years the trade and economic Wagner when Tom we know it's not the people's fault it was the fault of the government's so I really pleased if many more American tourists keep coming to get to know our country longer Rodriguez is in the only one looking forward to an increase in U.

S. tech companies anonymous Reno is a director of the American society in council of the Americas a Latin American policy think tank I asked to hug just after she arrived in Cuba about the communications and she said he was still very difficult people have a long way to go to global standards and internet connectivity and it has a very low rate application equipment household underrated slightly higher I'm I'm looking for a government agent says well I think you know why we take a big step forward in terms of use roaming agreement to being able to actually talk you know while waiting for the day when we can counting Cuba over our concerns and actually you can pretty talented in April and acting out like well Google is one of the fans planning to help develop internet services on the island Jason mark Zach is director of the Latin American economic growth initiative at the Atlantic council in Washington DC he told me tales another sectors was still a way off because although there's been some tinkering the trade embargo between the US and Cuba is still in place in order for there to be full free trade we need to remove the embargo the what the president's done over the course the last fifteen months is chip away at aspects of the embargo but the embargo remains fully in place the developments that we've seen this rail flooring of relations do you think it will still make a dramatic difference to the lives of of ordinary Cubans so far the very fact that I suppose that most toys can can arrive freely in the country yes we've seen a dramatic increase in US tourists in two thousand fifteen that will continue to increase this year there those terrorists eat at restaurants that are owned by more than five hundred thousand Floyd Cubans those tourist tip taxi drivers tip bartenders are those jurors get money directly to the Cuban people in addition because of that increased tourism we've seen things like Airbnb now operating Cuba as also being a bit of a rush of tourists to come visit the island before they felt that said that be a a real American influence over in the future do you think that will happen and the keeper that we see today will just changed completely frankly we've already seen the key but Cuba changing because of the influx of tourists for example Cuba now has wifi spots available on with eighty new spots opening up this year those types of I'm services are things that tourists demand there's there things that American businesses wants more access to the internet and those benefits then filter to the Cuban people as well but do you think that will still be resistance from Havana and a loss of regulation put in place to stop too much of a US influence over its economy and the way of life in Cuba yeah I think that we will see resistance from the accu been regime the Cubans are apprehensive about quick change on the island but despite that change and granting people greater each liberties is a basic human right for the people well that was Jason marks act that set of Latin America economic growth initiative at the Atlantic council in Washington DC you're listening to while business report from the BBC world service still to come on honesty is always the best policy in the corporate world you can never admits to not enjoying the job instead you must insist that it's stimulating and going well and that you are entirely and control my chairman is an idiot is something often thought which must never be offset more from Lucy Callaway coming up investigators in China have uncovered a huge illegal vaccine operation involving hospitals and health centers across the country China's drug regulators working to trace the whereabouts of almost nineteen million dollars worth of vaccines it said that because they were in properly stored some could cause disability what even death the ring leaders have been arrested were allegedly a mother and a daughter who purchased the vaccines from licensed and unlicensed sources and then sold them on at high prices the scandal has caused widespread anger because it so much that the authorities had been a wet the operation for some time the BBC's Chinese service and satisfying chatting Toby more about how the story unmatched the case is being going on for years now nearly it was discovered back in April last year it was first reported this Friday only last Friday that's why the cost fusion from Chinese public saying Howdy authorities keep applying island that and because he's has it threatens people's health and especially babies and that water is the parents and mommies and Daddies souls very much so at the moment simply because they don't know whether to take their children to be vaccinated because until shoal whether the vaccines held at the local hospital will be safe exactly I mean de affected vaccinations is reported as an effective in twenty four provinces and that municipalities in China's huge area no one knows where they are now that's why do authorities asked to Tracy down he did give a deadline of this Friday for those who get involved especially Asians especially the health centers to come forward to provide their names and Asians so that police can track him down and it would be any agents all health centers who had contacts with this particular mother and daughter who apparently her at the center of this operation yes I mean this particular at lady and she's forty seven year old she once worked as a doctor in the local hospital packing two thousand nine what extraordinary is that she was already sentenced three years in prison with five year suspension and because of the same thing yes she was convicted alpha Huff illegal selling T. vaccination and now people Askari why for second time around should do the same thing to it even greater scale that I love and hate a million Bucks exactly so nice wide to people also criticize the government saying that as a regulator as the government has already emphasize how important it is for food and safety related to people's health steel prying I would tend to and this case is not be discovered earlier is that not that the faster health and safety scatter in China of course many people remember the baby milk scandal will happen that the baby milk scandal happened in two thousand eight right after the Beijing Olympics and exploded across them in the nation and even chance top leaders asked the severe punishment for those involved but I think that severe punishment has not put people stop from doing it we can see the latest cases and together with many other cases especially China China's gonna want without severe punishment including back in two thousand seven de director for food and saved at the next administration was executed for corruption so I think because of the huge profiting involved because of the regulation especially implementation awful or those rules and regulations I'm not fully adhere to that's why people want to take the risk to make a profit so far have that been any deaths recorded co incidentally today the reason report in south China's Guangdong province a four year bowl he died after vaccination but authorities cameras immediacy clear himself saying that it has nothing to do with state latest vaccination but we're not sure and the public is still very doubt about it Cummings I'd say and that was the BBC Chinese service editor shrunk chatter that story spot fury on social media with thousands of users on the Weibo network talking about the scandal huevo ism microblogging service which has eclipsed Twitter in China attracting almost a third of all web uses that the competition is becoming tougher Twista which celebrates a milestone today it's ten years since the first ever tweet was sent the one hundred forty carries a message was an instant hit that it wasn't any game until someone use the service at a technology festival as the site's co founder biz stone explains most of the story geeks and nerds go to the interactive festival they network they party there was a guy who is a crowded bar in downtown Austin Texas and he wanted to be able to talk more with his friends that part was just too loud and crowded so we sent out a tweet that said let's go to this other Barney named it and in the eight or ten minutes it took him to walk to that bar it had completely filled to capacity there's a line out the door well after that it all took off out of the past decade to which he has played a significant role in revolutionizing communication journalism and politics but its stock market value has fallen because of concerns about its ability to attract new users and advertises Patrick Smith is a proposed at buzzfeed he's been on Twitter since the early days he very much felt that there was no dividing line between the normal people and celebrities and sports doesn't reprimand be trapped early on of ice to talk to Stephen fry a very famous a British actor and writer star of fed the small screen also and he's also a big guy techno file and an early adopter and he was one of the people who quite early on used to it's just explain what he was doing and instead I just his thoughts on things and we it was confirmed by them though it's a very different face Stephen fry if left to itself because he says it's that no longer a magical pool instead it's this huge city full of trolls and dole says the company is having problems attracting enough advertisers the problem is that I have the eternal digital media conundrum that that people have faced since the dawn of the incident really which is to what extent do you sell your uses attention for financial gain and to what extent do you leave advertising free because you just don't tend to like outside especially when into ropes that service and and this is the problem that's what the house now I'm thinking creasing the we might see more ok first on our time line but I have to diversify and think about how to use things like images and video making on the future rather than just interrupting someone and say Hey here's a sponsor to eat at the same time they have competition with the likes of we voted in China Snapchat's all kind of latest death pretenders to the throne how do they still gain new uses thus it interesting question and I think in the long term macroeconomic picture that the rights of something like when he spoke and I know Russian site a few cable called I think how they are combatant rice and beans non English services is actually really big question I don't think that I have announced to how'd you get new uses I think firstly you need to make the service simpler you to look at what Facebook stone and as soon as you sign up to Facebook it's clear why you're fat and how you doing you answer the question how you feeling or what you're doing today Facebook actually asked you that question where is when you're on Twitter people's first reaction is often why am I here what do I do now and unless you are a journalist or an analyst or politician or somebody who disseminates information for a living he can often feel quite an abstract place to be you know quite sure what what you do next time interrupt with people and I believe the vast majority pretty uses Sino made to treat once a twice and then never return when that was at peace Smith from buzzfeed best check in with a financial markets now and speak to act like a carry a fidelity international highlighted that live in my because so tell me would be in the movie is on the London exchange today because it didn't do so well as the other European induces did it despite that we found that we saw in China unidentified two hundred pigeons pitch appendix room minds hostage to the fortunes of commodities and the largest commodity companies now despite the recent week seeing a rebound in a lot of commodity companies and and many people saying oh are we seeing the first green shoots of recovery at this week things are looking a lot different the biggest for us today Anglo American dealing Cole I have concerns of a fresh supply glut in oil has once again white of the oil price and that of course is hit the likes of shall and BP the big thing to look at his review the dollar because as we know commodity commodities in the dollar have it inverse relationship over the dollar weakening last week that was a boost to commodity company and also there's been quite a bit of movement as far as retail stocks are concerned and that's our retail giant Sainsbury's in the UK a sh goodness aloft a south African firms that it didn't actually work to to buy a fund that is interested in so lots of movement in the international retells that's France's centuries price up slightly today as it's finally kid that deal with home retail group and and specifically and it had its eyes on August which is part of the group because it wants to invest more in the internet delivery Stein of was a competitor lurking in the background but Stein of has confirmed today that it is not interested anymore lots of movement that okay thank you very much Mikey carry from fidelity let me give you some latest numbers now from the financial markets the footsie one hundred index was down five points at sixty one eighty four down point eight essentials hunger in New York the Dow Jones was up by twenty points whole point one two percent at some two thousand six hundred and twenty three you're listening to well business reports on the BBC world service and it's a special good evening to our listeners on digital short wave of DRM in India on five point eight four five megahertz now honesty as the old saying goes is the best policy knocks it seems when you're the boss of a company every trabecular comes as in DC Callaway now of the Financial Times eventually Erica friend landed a grand job running a medium sized company a few weeks and I had lunch with him and he told me he was having a pretty grim time Hafiz stuff was mediocre the culture was sleepy and it wasn't a total sure his plan to change things would work last week we mass again and I'll just how it was going great he said soul good when I congratulated him on having whipped everything into shape he replied that the only thing he had so far managed to whip into shape was himself it worked out that the first thing you have to do is a chief executive it's a land to lie for a start you can never admit to not enjoying the job or even to finding it stressful instead you must insist that it's stimulating and going well and that you are entirely and control next you can never hinge the dislike or don't rate anyone you work with my chairman is an idiot is something often thought which must never be after it even less can you disparage anyone who works for you and then bad mouthing your company is out of the question you're responsible for it and for everyone who works that and you have to be chief cheerleader at all times however on natural that feels the anytime it's possible to say something negative is when you can either blame it on your predecessor or when you have a plan up your sleeve for improving masses even then though such talk can still be dangerous the final thing my friend his land is never to tell anyone that he's not show as chief executive you can't say when making this takeover but I'm not entirely sure if it will pay off instead you have to present every initiative as a no brainer no serious doubts over strategy for basin but admissions of self doubts have ruled out to even though many of the best chief executives are riddled with it they must not ever say I'm not sure I'm up to this for fear they'll be taken at face value possibly these for forbidden tree this can be confided to a sympathetic spouse in the dead of night but that's about as far as it's wise to go it's all pretty constraining especially given how hard the job is my friend reports that the only good thing about pretending to be having a great time is that helps you convince yourself that you actually are the bad thing is it's thoroughly alienating if you can't tell your friends what you really failed then there isn't much point in having friends in the first place as I headed back to work after lunch is occurred to me that his list was not complete the father to boo and he had just broken that the fifth thing you can never say as a chief executive is my job involves lying does anyone acceptable view of what it takes to be a great leader which is that you have to be honest at all times in real life a chief executive Canadian forward to be honest up to a point and that's the scope for honesty is so curtailed that the job is quite unsuited to anyone who like my friend is too addicted to saying what they really think this is Lisa Calloway the BBC world service however very honest correspondent from the Financial Times that now had it will business report was celebrating a very special
