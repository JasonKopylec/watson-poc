this is world business report from the BBC world service I'm Susanna's Teresa the German government vans to stick with its refugee policy despite gains by the anti immigration far right does show that the country's very polarized ray fragmented and it could be that medical will draw some comfort from all this she is weakened but all her interest rates have also been weakened in different ways Green Party also win control of a regional parliament well the results have repercussions that German economic policy plus that French investigators say the pilot to deliberately crashed a passenger aircraft was showing signs of psychosis do doctors need new guidance about went to flag up patients who are a threat to the public we do understand that there is some confusion there among some doctors about that line where it is to be drawn and what the limits of confidentiality should be and that is the big lesson from this particular a report plus he comes the sun a huge solar power plant goes live in South Africa the project like Bob would will of course ones running be able to be a continuous operator and show the world that effectively assist the plant would storage can compete with conventional thumb about plans that's all coming up that fast it was a difficult day German chancellor Angela Merkel's was today she reflected on the pool regional election results for her conservative Christian Democrats policy significant gains by the anti immigrant AFT policy at the expense of the CD you have been put down to discontent with Mrs knuckles open door policy on migration speaking at a news conference in Berlin she acknowledge that frustration about immigration was one of the reasons for the poll result but set that would be no change in policy es mas oud ourselves artist community models predicting the dominating topic was the refugee policy the fact that in the view of the people there is nice truancy a significant influence on the result of the election I strongly believe and this wasn't question today that we need a European solution but there is no sustainable solution yet over four hundred how stunts on migrants has been backed by the leader of the Green Party which also made significant gains in Baden Baden but the greens became the biggest policy in a regional parliament for the first time so it begins on the left and also to the far right it's clear that many voters want to change to the status quo so what could that mean for economic policy and a country considered to be the powerhouse of Europe well first of all aspects of the general secretary of the Green Party in Germany Michael Kellner Walser historic success what's that the first time ever in German history that the Green Party came out strongest party in one of the major land that in Germany in Barton looking back really you've successfully now one reason this movie our front runner vin Creta Kretschmann he did a marvelous campaign what is you'll economic policy that you communicated to voters in a way regretful that and in a state where strong German industries spotlight congresses in the way that we want Saddam as green so the green to future we not thinking to get high environmental issues and economic issues and death wanna kind of agreeing transformation also wealth in he's in a way told a story that that in green ideas allies to future also hoodlum industries you policy leader has also been supportive of Angola miracles policy on migrants do you see migrants is the future for Germany in the numbers that they have and took the country Germany meets migrations buckets also a quite a challenge to cope with want peace large numbers of of refugees in Germany we need you clean solution to these questions source of it was a very pro European approach this in the campaign and this was clearly that we support argued a miracle and in her way to find the you Michael cannon that's on the Green Party in Germany leather tricks when destroys the MEP of the anti immigration a hefty policy I asked her why she thought how close he had made such significant gains we have such a success at the very moment because all the other parties which a running do not focus on what is in the concerns of the people and of course we had a huge debate about migration which is all the case all over here Europe and we have a god who is going very very key line on the migration issue I we want to because of August and we said that we can't take more refugees focusing on the economy projections show that Germany needs an or for loss of migration for it to really function in the coming decades im pay for all the pensions for example of those taxes need days surely these refugees could really help plug that gap over what some people say that that they start to realize that people coming to us but not the kind of migrants we need what we need is highly educated people and what we see is that those people coming to earth in the vast majority not highly educated and not not able to be highly educated so what we need is labor force and what we get is migrants which we did not choose that many of those people coming from Syria are highly educated record this is just one of those talks which is just not true and it doesn't get more troops and more often you repeated the vast majority of people we get our hero and also that I'm so this is nothing which is itself also used for labor market which is focusing on highly educated article that was businessman story from the a FDC policy while David mouse's head of the official monetary and financial institutions forum I'll ask him if he was surprised by the results it is something of an earthquake if you simply look at it and statistical terms this is really the first time since the reverse of German democracy after the second World War that you've had a right wing populist policies come to the surface in such a big way across a whole swathe of Germany novel party called a hefty present in a state parliaments and they came actually from New three states to state parliament time is certainly given charge of a medical something of a bloody nose in terms of showing but her policy on migration and is very very unpopular but in real terms in terms of what this means for her as a leader she can probably draw some comfort from is paradoxically enough because her coalition partners the Social Democratic Party they did very badly much person her party did so she is still the only woman standing here on the German political scene and the greens have also maze games haven't may taking over a rule controlled the regional parliament for the first time and they have supported Mrs Michael starts on migration as well haven't may is shows how fragmented the German scene is because the greens did very well in Baden Baden bag which one of the most wealthy parts of Germany very industrial so basically you wouldn't imagine the greens would do all that well created great well they're very badly and neighboring violent listening to showing regional sensibilities tradition that the country's very polarized a very fragmented but doesn't give one universal message this whole series of rather fragmentary messages and it could be that medical will draw some comfort from all this she is weakened but all her adversaries have also been ways and given that it seems politically the country's becoming so polarize it will be difficult romantic to try and draw some of those economic policies that set the rifles who make great gains have been trying to promote to the electorate ch it will be hard to draw those in well into an appeal to a wider base in future elections the ASD don't really have any policies on the economy close to the Europa Germany's in the year is gonna be favorite genesis came you're right we do know that the SeniorNet government in Berlin the one that Mrs Meg who is in charge of with a Christian Democrats they're going to have to take a more pragmatic live on austerity and basically over issues some of the budgetary targets anyway because of the huge amount of pressure on public spending caused by the influx of refugees so already the economic policy has changed and the facts are and they will be much less a finger wagging at the other European countries by Mrs medical and her friends in the government because they actually need some solidarity from the other country as well so I believe the true fixes may well be the government's involves and initially with Mr alongs understood principle that backs against the wall domestically they both need a bit of extra German understanding over their own budget stream problems and they may not get it because Michael is weaker and she needs friends abroad and those people in Paris and a roommate just turn out to be this friend and that was David mas head of the official monetary and financial institutions forum let's check in now with the financial markets and Jerry that stone call from Charleston is with me tell me you've been watching the results of those elections with interest the European central banks Domenici policies very controversial in Japanese net I Hoces other yes it is Sir the Germans have historically feuds European central bank policy extreme skeptically particular course decisions take the overnight interest rates further into negative territory I actually happen to agree with quite a lot of what I heard in those reports that I thought that Sir it's fair to say the Serb wells miracles power base has been eroded so has thus of some of her major competitors but of course it's a CD you see S. U. coalition and I just since the alternative Deutschlands at this up and coming policy is rather like the National Front policy in Paris you know young firebrand leader the map of Europe that is changing a new generation of political leaders is beginning to emerge so I would not belittle this results and I think it would be a huge mistake the medical and her supporters to blisters this could be the start of something sticky with immigration of course going back on the radar screens we get the summer look at the wider market oil has dropped back again what's driving that I'm well of following a real supportive comment from the I. E. A. on Friday evening we had opaque delivering a dose of reality late this afternoon OPEC arguing that due to weak global economic activity demand for oil is going to be very subdued and therefore there will be higher surplus as yet nothing has been done to address the difference between supply which is substantial and amount which is weak and of course nothing that any of the producers as saying at the moment lenses sell to any kind of agreement to cut output okay demi about sick of them tell Sonny many thanks the latest numbers for you the footsie one hundred thirty four points to sixty one seventy four and a New York the Dow Jones up thus it seventeen thousand two hundred and forty four you're listening to well business report from the BBC world service still to come it's now becoming Valga to boast about how long you walk shorts allies equal high status more from Lucy Callaway from the Financial Times coming up the pilots who flew the Germanwings Ashcroft into a French mountainside killing one hundred and fifty people on board was showing signs of psychosis that's among the findings of investigators who've been prepping the causes of the crash a gimmick at twenty seven year old Andreas lubitz who was suffering from depression was allowed to continue flying despite having been seen by doctors dozens of times in the preceding days their votes called folk cables on the lifting of medical confidentiality of pilot show signs of psychological problems the BBC's their luggage was been following the story and he told me more about the findings pretty clear that the co pilot had a history of depressive illness and that's in the weeks before the accident he consulted a number of different doctors several of whom had issued medical certificate sunset nights exempt him from work one doctor had actually diagnosed a possible psychosis and recommended a hospitalization until he'd recovered do you know why he hadn't done so is does this report go into to detail about this as well well it's pretty clear that he didn't tell anybody about it and he didn't contact any of the pilots organizations that have been set up to provide sort of pit support for pilots who might be in this kind of condition another report speculates on not to suggest that one reason why he may not sort of like to the authorities to his own condition was because he was suffering possibly a psychosis which is a distancing from reality so he may not have been thinking clearly and not so but that was also a very strong financial motive for him to stay quiet because if he had alerted the authorities that he was suffering from depression that he was also incidently on anti depressant medicine and sleeping pills it's highly likely he would have been considered unfit to fly and would have been removed from duties now that would have hit his income he did have insurance to cover some of his debts which he'd run up in his pilot training but he wouldn't of had any other means for carrying out his day to day life a great many people died on board both passengers and crew all that family saying anything about this report the families have all along been very critical of love Tanza the parent company of Germanwings saying that more should have been done potentially to provide support for the the pilot to weed out pilots who have potentially problematic mental conditions but on the other hand you have pilots unions who say that too much psychological screening could be a bad thing that pilots could be unnecessarily removed from duty while investigations occurring on and don't forget that Andreas lubitz wants regularly recessed his psychiatric condition was assessed the with the nose on his file that he had suffered depression very early in his career and on each occasion the era medical examiner decided that he was fit to fly and that was the BBC's their luggage but just how difficult is it for doctors to know when to alert authorities to a potential threat to public health and break patient confidentiality who has a question I put to professor Robert Bork consultant clinical psychologist who assesses the mental health of pilots as part of his job it reminded I've ever worked with has always erred on the side of safety themselves they would rather not be working van in the Germanwings scenario with the person so to conceal their difficulties from others and office he to commit suicide in a work setting so that you know I mean it's an incredibly rare experience in aviation so for the very fast majority opined that we see it won't ever get to that point shouldn't be honest be on the doctors to think this person's condition has deteriorated and it's now a public safety issue absolutely and in fact that is always I think understood and it's about the world over with any pilot who goes to a doctor and that talk to feel you know whether it's visual impairment or some kind of mental problem that they could be some jeopardy to safety would act in in some way arm to ensure that that person was receiving the right treatment what appears to have happened here now that we have read reported that there was a failure of communication between the civilian doctors in Germany and I think what is important here is the the civilian doctors and not part of the aviation specialization and they're in Germany and we do understand that there is some confusion there among some doctors about that line where it is to be drawn and what the limits of confidentiality should be and that is the big lesson from this particular a report in other countries do you think that line is drawn sufficiently my understanding is that the line is actually very clear doctors don't like to breach confidentiality ever I think they will always do so very reluctantly but in weighing up the threat to our public harm that is something that is for most a lot more straightforward and in certain kinds Norway and Israel it is meant date tree for a civilian doctor who believes that the pilot maybe in some jeopardy or is likely to cause harm to the population but to and to break confidentiality and to report this they shouldn't invade mandates mean all countries I think it is understood to be that is the extent to which doctors will implement it I don't think that the laws need change to adjustment my understanding is that they need to be properly adhered to and that's what didn't happen in this particular case Hudson could hide some of the symptoms from doctors because they feel as though that career would be over if they showed certain symptoms which could and that Korea for that put probably happened in this case here the fear that he would lose his job prevented him from doing the most honest and all the thing that he should have done but there are other systems in place and other people who come to who we encounter who have you know act as a fullback so for example every time a policy that the controlled opiate copilot's observing them fights when they go out for a crew rest there is a dispatcher sometimes passengers and other crew members will also observed that parted so the likelihood of that happening is incredibly infrequent that we look back in the last thirty years we understand that there probably being around six or seven pilot suicides and although everyone of that is completely unacceptable emphatically actual numbers that are involved here remains incredibly lows and so it is still a very safe system provided everybody exercising the right judgment and that was princess and wild boar consultant clinical psychologists stretching as far as the eye can see huge fields of solar panels have been switched on in South Africa to try and plug the country's electricity deficit just two weeks after George apple became the first on the continent to be powered by energy from the sun huge solar energy and storage plant opened today in the Northern Cape province it'll have one of the world's biggest solo Brady seller radiation footprints and promises to generate enough power for a course at the million homes day and tonight I spoke to the managing director of the plant none do Buddha and he'd tell me more about how the technology works well they parabolic trough so they effectively concave couple of murders that reflect the sun's light onto a central troop this running along it so you have room fields of these concave mirrors that have achieved in it and we have HTF which is high temperature fluid that's flying through it and that is used as your eating fluid to eventually drive a steam turbine South Africa has really suffered with blackouts over recent years to what extent will this plug help plug the energy deficit well this is one of many plans that I actually supporting the south African grid and in particular Eskom as the sole provider of power in the country so that IPP programs been extremely successful in that we got pretty close to three thousand megawatts to the grid and providing relief to the though the current good ball utility so from that perspective yes this is the spot plays a huge role is also low class in the sense that it now has the thermal storage system and wished allows the plant to be not only a renewable generator but also a baseload continuous operator this push for renewables is being driven by the south African government but given the huge investment costs of this type of technology it could be in a fifteen twenty years before I feel actually pays for itself couldn't it wouldn't it be cheaper ready to invest in something that's not renewable at this current time was oil prices so depressed I think that's that's actually not quite true because of the price reduction in over the various bits process is that the south African government have put on the table we started of with around one bids with the IPP program which had quite high prices but if you look at the place will be outlawed now it round three going to run for the prices have really dive to a point where we are almost at parity with conventional power prices so the the conventional politicians don't have much on that rely on the renewable program right now on and the fact that we are now having see is people on that is becoming cost competitive with storage making them also despicable Powell plans they become extensively equally competitive even so South Africa is still pretty reliant on call how to try and persuade policy makers not just in South Africa but in other parts of the world rarely that this is the time to switch well I mean the the the issue here is to show success in projects like book work so the project like Bob would will of course ones running be able to be of a continuous operator and show the world that effectively assisted bloodwood storage can compete with conventional thumb about blogs the thing is that in other parts of the world it's to simply notice Sonny is South Africa they really still does need to be a mix of both the traditional technology is like coal and gas and renewables doesn't now no definitely I don't believe there's a good out there that needs to be solely solar I think solar can complement current technologies countries like South Africa have a benefit of a world of us resourcing in Colin Powell's so we must use that that is ninety percent of our current technology base however we are diversifying would bring in wind brilliancy SP and and other additional investment in nuclear put potentially so that I think it's you require div diverse mix it also spread your risk and to bring technology close to the ground so that at least we have different options to consider it depending on your your your atmospheric conditions and the mental resources that you have available I thought that was the MD at the plant and do Pula how are you listening to this in a car honking away through traffic head down with headphones in racing into work or are you attempting to do the dishes and cook dinner simultaneously while overseeing homework anyway however you're listening is it time perhaps for you to slow down a little Lucy Callaway the Financial Times thinks her explains why mostly because social event for senior bank because that was a discussion on what people were trying to give up almost everyone was trying to go a few weeks without alcohol about from one man he said he was trying to give up something much tougher he was trying to quit excessive walk not just for a few weeks but for the rest of his life he was fed up with pointless meetings and of emailing at eleven PM sisters in couple of weeks earlier he had achieved just as much as before but on average had worked no more than seven hours a day and spent the rest of his time enjoying himself that's nothing extraordinary about this it all makes perfect sense work expands to fill the time available and all that and this man was senior enough to dictate his own schedule but the reason I make so much of this story is that for the past two decades overpaid professionals have been not just working around the clock but boasting about it to get here was someone at the top of a competitive workaholic industry trying to make himself seem even bigger in the eyes of his pairs not by saying how much she was but how little it's possible that this is the beginning of something big Bucks and Russell and John may not Keynes both predicted this in the nineteen thirties it's been a long time coming but maybe it's happening lost she told me that in and lead to executive circles in the U. S. things are beginning to change justice it's vulgar to post about how much you consume it's now becoming Valga to boast about how long you walk is a vanguard of people she claimed who is starting to make the sort of post my banker was making shorts allies equal high status at the time I like to have very but saw no signs of it being true instead what I saw were the friends of my children starting out in consulting on the Lowell not only did they seem to work longer hours than ever they look down on anyone who left work at six PM but now I'm wondering if half and I might be right self rule for years employers in Sweden a country that was never a fan of either working have been experimenting with a six hour day there are signs that workaholic Anglo Saxons are looking on with approval rather than superiority the independent newspapers just run an online poll asking whether a similar experiment impression would make after a more productive about ninety five percent said it would as my bank has bug I studied the faces of the water swelling man he was addressing one snorted and said good luck with that but the other four item with what looked like resentment laced with pure envy and other words his boast worked magnificently our correspondent for the Financial Times via some breaking news now on the BBC Russian president Vladimir Putin has ordered the military to withdraw the main part of the forces in Syria saying they had largely achieved that goals the Palat will start on Tuesday more coming up from BBC news on that but thanks for listening to wealth business reports from all of us here good bye there are many ways to keep up with the BBC world service join us on social media or sign of a pot costs and BBC world service dot com slash part because
