this is the world business report from the BBC world service I'm Alex Ritson Brazil's former president Lula da Silva has been blocked by the courts from taking a job in his successes government opponents say his attempted appointment was a blatant attempt to avoid prosecution for corruption some people and some politics are saying that denomination easy strategy to protect Tallulah from being investigated or even arrested during this car wash pro it's six hundred days since the last boatload of would be migrants turned up on Australia's coastline will be asking if that means Europe should be learning lessons from the tough treatment given to refugees down unda Europe you know is a boxing some of the worst wars seen in recent history and I don't think any number of fences being built in southeastern Europe is going to prevent the large scale migration Britain's latest budget was notable for its lack of green policies campaign a se London is out of step with the rest of the world take China in the last year alone they've added more wind power capacity in the UK has got in its entirety plus what to Bill Gates Steve Jobs and mark Zuckerberg all have in common apart from achieving great wealth and fame will have the answer for you during the next thirty minutes nndb when Linda sue who was elected president of Brazil he promised to change the lives of the pool but now he sparking street protests over allegations of involvement in corruption at the state run oil company Petrobras an attempt by his success of the current president Dilma Rousseff to make him a minister in her government that's been blocked by the courts it was widely seen as a move to protect him from prosecution because ministers Computron in any court lower than Brazil's Supreme Court where the judges are appointed by the president president Dilma and former president Lula discussed the matter in a very friendly telephone call which was secretly recorded and then released to the media by the investigating judge causing mass protests on the streets of Rio and elsewhere we've used actors to voice up that discussion in English later I need to tell you something go ahead there right I'm sending better safer with the papers say that we have them just in case they needed that the terms of office I can I don't know that's good that's good that's everything weight that he's heading either that okay I'll be here I'm waiting it's like Hey that's good I but I made it okay Jacobson is from Brazil's workers party which is the party by former president Lula and president Dilma belong to us to buy the leaders critics will right to suggest he was only trying to become a government minister to avoid prosecution well perhaps rubbish because you can be prosecuted anyway he shows that Stephanie Supreme Court even if they all the locals have no have no influence on evil black metal doesn't make any difference a difference all the all the different experience they switch tribunal can judges it makes quite a difference if the lower courts contest against him surely yeah sure you and you are not all of the minister's economic be investigated and prosecuted by disagreeing chords but you must realize how that looks to the rest of the world well this is the problem here is that we are facing distribution against the party against himself against the president's weekend being absolutely a political persecution Brazil's stock market was up about ten percent a short time ago investors seemingly enjoying the damage the scandal is doing to the government Louis Covina is a reporter from Brazil's Cuban landed a TV station he told me the allegations Luna is facing a serious he was forcibly called to talk with the federal police like in the beginning of the month about some properties that supposedly we're given to him by construction companies it's a penthouse on the coast of some Polish state and arranged and interior of some Polish state well he denies these corruption allegations and say that from the opposition and the suggestion is that he is only being given this job by the current president research in order that he should have immunity from prosecution exactly some people and some politics are saying that denomination easy strategy to protect Tallulah from being investigated or even during this car wash pro this morning in Brasilia is now the chief of staff so he can only being investigated now by the Supreme Court but when he was the president he was one of the most popular presidents in the history of Brazil in at the time everything seem to be going for him is it not just possible that this is something which is being created by his political opponents that's what's a dis investigation about corruption scandals are are arguably over because like you said during the period he was president or as you grew a lot we wait out of the poverty line so it's really strange by now but that's the point that these investigations are going to see if a the way that things went during that period it might have some well illegal illegal ways you know what's the involvement of the current president analysts Lula almost created do you mind if we can say that she was the chief of staff during Lula's government but now she's facing lots of anti government protests like less to someday own mediums of people took to the streets to demonstrate against the government it was the biggest anti government protests Ligustrum Brazil lily Cavallini from Brazil's Ebola India TV station Australia is celebrating something of a milestone it's six hundred days since the last time a boatload of illegal migrants arrived on its coastline illegal migrants had been a huge problem with more than twelve hundred people dying as they tried to reach Australia by boat between two thousand and eight and twenty thirteen then the Australian government launched what it calls operations sovereign borders spin a highly controversial program which features adverts like this the Australian government has introduced the toughest border protection measures ever if you travel by boat without a visa you will not make astrology high the message is simple if you come to Australia illegally but but there is no way you will ever make astrology high journalist Steven main from Maine reporter told me the whole purpose is to make would be refugees feel unwelcome well under the previous labor government earlier fifty two thousand unauthorised arrivals apocalypse Ryan shows in this court water public disquiet and the conservative government time invested by Tony Abbott napa Malcolm Turnbull with a very tough regime which included turning back boats on the high seas and that the stood determinedly not letting anyone arrive so that's been affected because we've now been six hundred die since the last version arrived in twenty five different parts have been turned back and discordant under people currently on the tension in the room and then asylum but it has stopped about it's even though it's been very controversial the international so this is about sending a message to people who want to come to Australia who are considering crossing the ocean it's you're not welcome here what I try to government clients that smashed the people smugglers business model and even when you deal and recently offered to take a hundred fifty refugees from the romantic sound the government rejected that because I felt it would have been an incentive for people to come because you can shop and not country like you deal so the ongoing quandary with the policies where do the people in detention finish up and the government is in negotiation with the locks of allies in the Philippines and Indonesia but the strategy is to have an unattractive country where they will finish shopping so that I don't have any incentive to get going about trying come to a stronger so it's a it's a pretty unpleasant process boss it works and what you're saying here is the end justifies the means but certainly the government's position on the local party which you know did did did have twelve hundred deaths at sea when it was in office with those fifty two thousand unauthorised arrivals I have now fall into line and I support a tax regime and I support offshore the tensions that with the bipartisan position now to be very tough and the public is satisfied with that was ongoing controversy with I many refugee advocates and that is ongoing reports about poor treatment in in the room and a solid better things like the number of children in detention which did take it almost two thousand people a little bit the labor government in that down to about sixty children engines but that's the approach that I think that's a look we just got one of hypocrisy Lawson high say they should stay where they are and I don't mean in Indonesia and other places in in in appetizer and they shouldn't Australia and that's perfect now they've not been coming for sort of a six hundred bytes that Stephen made a journalist with Australia's main reporter putting the case for the Australian government not everyone is convinced though Danny stricken diraja campaigns for the rights of refugees for the civic a script he told me Australia's attitude is wrong on every level sadly most people familiar with international legal obligations around migration around basic human rights consider this an ultimate failure in Australia's obligations to asylum seekers and those people who are fleeing persecution and warm around the world what a study saying it hasn't allowed anyway to Australia to find refuge in that come but in the five years prior to the introduction of this policy twelve hundred people died crossing to Australia and boats and those are just the ones we know about who absolutely we need to address the regular migratory froze the desperate measures that people have to take to get to somewhere but I don't think shutting off straight into the rest of the world is the right solution I think we need to invest a lot more in policing what happens in those times reward as kind of course allowing for legal channels by which those seeking refuge can come to a place like Australia is going to be part of the solution as well but Australia says the legal channels open if people want to come by legal route they still kind what they're doing here is shutting down the illegal roots and thereby putting the people traffickers who just doing this to make a profit out of business the fundamental challenge here is that there are vast numbers of people around the world who are being displaced for all sorts of reasons and we as civilized humanity have created a set of rules norms those people you need protection are able to find protection on the site for the world but what's happened systematically in the last few decades in Australia has been at the forefront of this is that we've started to pare down those commitments and the ability of those people seeking refuge to have any chance of finding asylum so we sort of fueling displacement through walls in places like Syria and Afghanistan and Sri Lanka but we're not creating the mechanisms by which those people can find refuge and so no wonder at that unscrupulous people smugglers can make profit out of this desperation there may be some real refugees but an awful lot of them were just economic migrants what they **** what's becoming clearer is that people who are displaced from places like Syria or Afghanistan are incredibly desperate some of them yes are persecuted many them do have economic and other motives but under international law countries like Australia are obliged to give them a fair hearing to see if they really are in need of seeking there will be people in Europe who look at the Australian experience see twelve hundred lives at least lost before this policy was introduced those lives are now being saved and say we should be doing this off the coasts of Greece I think they should be also asking how many lives are being lost by people who are stuck in parts of the world where there is war in person about a my worry about straight in exile Poland firing many European leaders isn't a stranger is a rare country that can have a chance of sealing off its borders because of its great great distance from other parts of the world it that's just not going to be possible in in Europe for example it's you know Europe is sitting you know is a boxing some of the worst wars seen in recent history and I don't think any number of fences being built in southeastern Europe is going to prevent the large scale migration that we've seen in recent years continuing impacts even getting thicker Tony Sri scan diraja who campaigns for the rights of refugees for the civic to school you're listening to world business report from the BBC world service still to come paying for an MBA is it really worth it when costs can be up to one hundred and sixty thousand dollars effort if it's like a huge struggle and you have to save up and paid off your whole life it's kind of is a really worth it ten years ago we were being told that climate change caused by industry was going to destroy a world governments were full of ideas for new laws and taxes that would encourage people to change their behavior and save the planet the climate change seems to foreign out of fashion as a political issue Britain's finance minister delivered his latest budget yesterday unlike his counterparts in the rest of the world green measures didn't feature particularly strongly Andrew Simpson economist from the new weather institute he told me he wasn't impressed one of the big disappointments was in the area of renewable energy solar and wind power levels again hit recently by the removal of a lot of incentives there was nothing in there to bring them around that was a little bit in for offshore wind which the treasury says is new money but I think for people who are looking at the budget for its environmental credentials the thing which really would have struck them with the building on the huge tax break given to the fossil fuel companies last year for North Sea oil there a whole swathe of new and tax cuts for them to pass another tax break fat Sheldon B. P. they must've been rather pleased with that in fact the shares went up what I think they probably were very pleased and there's a bit of a double whammy where the public purse is concerned does these new tax breaks given to them but the office for a budget responsibility also suspects predicts that the tax take from that sector is going to drop to nothing and then go effectively negative in a couple of years time so one of the sectors that the public purse relied upon quite heavily until a few years ago it is not going to be paying in and it's going to be taking out effectively isn't this the inevitable that chancellor is facing tough economic times and green measures are are not vote winners when people are trying to hang on to that jobs what if you want to kind of rebuild the economy I think the logic behind giving tax breaks to the fossil fuel centers is that it's in protection of jobs but if one's going to be said logical about that the same would apply for the renewable energy sector propounding vested you create a lot more jobs and it's very clear if you look at the international picture these are the future and the D. industries you talk about the global picture but ten years ago budgets all over the world were full of green measures now budgets all over the world are not full of great measures that there is a trend that was in that area it's it's it's because the economy of the world is in trouble taker of a big part of the global economy rising part the globe economy like China where they've been inviting it will kinds of problems but in the last year alone they've added more wind power capacity in the UK has got in its entirety you look at the U. S. they're adding huge amounts of new win palace actually all around the world these industries all growing and if you look at the international labor organization where the so called green collar jobs are being created are being created took very great degree so I would say that that would be the future at all they being creative with government money sunny but China's concern but it's very hard to kind of draw the line between what is going to public and private in China obviously but there's a massive governmental push that and you look in other emerging economies like India you got some of them as a rapidly developing micro medium scale renewable technologies which very often helping people where they have the least access to electricity there will be people listening to this who think the real reason finance ministers around the world aren't putting so many green measures in that budgets now is because actually climate change if it was going to be a problem it would've happened by now it is happening now and that's part of the problem if you look at the fingerprint in a lot of the extreme weather events that happened over the last year increasingly it's impossible to say that the human fingerprint is is not that of course we now in the immediate aftermath of the Paris deal on climate change where you had an unprecedented consensus from government and from business about not just the fact that this was real it required urgent action but also that we should be being much more ambitious but the kind of targets we're setting ourselves to keep the temperature below a certain level above preindustrial levels so if you want to look at the one big area where the global economy is United and especially in terms of delivering for people at the bottom of the income part protecting them from the worst effects of climate change and creating economic opportunities the green economy is the one for the next generation Andrew Sims from the new whether institute let's take a look at what's been happening on the financial markets now a few moments ago in New York the Dow Jones indexes up point seven percent at seventeen thousand four hundred and forty six here in London they one hundred share index closed the day up point four percent at sixty two and one I'm joined in the studio by Ross mold who is in mint director at AJ felt like squats been driving the opposite sentiment I think it is really that the fact that the federal U. S. federal reserve America central bank took a much more dovish much gentler line inflation than people were expecting last night in December steel people to expect full interest rate increases this year now is talking about too even though it's preferred inflation make it what he calls core inflation as exceeded the target said he would look at when it came to future interest rates and interest rate moves but perversely they that the shares are going up but that the fed is essentially saying that the outlook for the global economy is is quite gloomy are bad news is good news self as far as shares a concern because it means that interest rates will stay low for longer which means if the returns on cash are poor investors may be false look other asset classes like jazz for example for a better return on their money some interesting individual stories on the foot CTI to of the executives of the top one hundred firms stepping down Sir Andrew Wittig GlaxoSmithKline some Walsh at Rio Tinto's that's something in the air what without actually nine foot two hundred companies talk about changing their boss this you already the average of the last decade is around twelve signal thing too unusual in that respect Walsh's army inherited a very difficult and it real tenso paying down debt restructuring the business during a big commodity price downturn Mister which SR under which he at Glaxo I think the interesting thing here is when he steps down next year will look completely broken up some of the shareholders say that a full very large companies in there they'll be better off separate surround was said not on his watch so let's see what happens when he steps down am looking elsewhere mining shares have been soaring today any particular reason again unless inflation trade we talked about earlier you thought she seemed base metals go up you see the oil price go up today that's help total explorers because of talk about packets hostile make on the seventeenth of April again looking at production freezes bridge the increasing copper prices zinc nickel base metals investors are looking at potential inflation threads the fed is gonna be softer inflation he will be looking to protect themselves by buying historic hedges against that which includes things like minus and as the bank of England going to be inspired in its interest rate setting policy doesn't doesn't seem to be no he voted today nine zero to leave interest rates at the record low at half percent for the eighty four consecutive months arm and I think at the moment the market is pricing in the first bank of England rate rise sometime in twenty seventeen Russ mold investment director at AJ bell thank you for coming into the studio today a few other numbers gold trading at one thousand two hundred and sixty three dollars an ounce on the currency markets a year I will buy you one dollar thirteen point to you a sense and the pound is trading at one dollar forty four point Bill Gates Steve Jobs mark Zuckerberg what do they all have in common that all college dropouts so why bother with a business degree let alone a graduate business degree if you can make it to the top of the business world without one from New York the BBC's Michelle flurry reports on the value of an MBA any property real ones you have to forgive professor stands before an auditorium of his students animated he discussing the ins and outs of pharmaceutical pricing because time here at Columbia business school one of America's top graduate business programs doesn't come cheap a masters of business administration or MBA at this Ivy League university set you back a hundred thirty thousand dollars a figure that doesn't include expenses like books and cost of living so is it worth it it is a risk and it does take I think a a level of risk tolerance for anyone who is considering an MBA ants Michael Malone and associate dean at the school despite the risk he says investing this much isn't he well worth taking the reality is is that it a top program like Columbia's the opportunities that are opened would not otherwise be there and so I believe firmly that this is one of the things that a top MBA program can add in terms of value is opening those doors that would otherwise be opened it's nnat and dnmt many MBA students a new award by the prospect of a handsome paycheck soon after graduating nasty the median starting salary for recent NBA Gratz was said to be a hundred thousand dollars to get a sense of what value people place on an NBA spoke with with that one depends what you want for depends a filter and I think many people can get around it actually people in your generation it really does depend if you have a job and you're going to get a lot of money in this job saliva I suppose I mean I think and Stephanie good investment but I think it's a bit ridiculous the person in this country because we're from England and it's so much cheaper though and I think I wonder if if it's like a huge struggle and you have to say well paid off your whole life it's kind of is it really worth it depending on where yes I think that's fine depending on where it is so if it's a good school is worth the investment of course but critics say getting an MBA is unnecessary and that many business school curriculums frankly outdated the value of the graduate business degree also depends on where the degree is from on the schools rank taking on major debt from an MBA program that isn't from a highly regarded top to school well that's not seen as a safe bet and then there's this question can leadership even be taught in a classroom so the original was actually the spicy garlic that's actually mom's recipe meat entrepreneur an MBA student can win co founder of Siouxsie source a startup that makes not control marinades and dressings we're spicy garlic fresh lemon sweet ginger and ginger glazed so he hopes his degree will give him and his company a leg up he thinks that the entrepreneurs learning by doing is more important than time in class I've been through the trenches you know having started from actually nothing creating something and you know hopefully going it was further it's you have to kind of have that mentality straight away and then be able to give you that surely believe tools but won't make you know Ken recently put his studies on hold to focus on his startup ask for his MBA he still wants to finish it eventually but if not he would be the first company leaders to put his business before his education shell furry with that report from New York some
