this is world business report from the BBC world service I'm Mike Johnson as plunging oil prices take their toll on Africa's biggest economy we are asked how should Nigeria respond analogy is a country which imports almost everything he doesn't really have a minor fracturing base this is an opportunity for Nigerians to make things that Nigerians knees Osama sedition a world overwhelmed by wheels some big cities reach peak car it is fifty five to sixty percent of the U. seventeen million people live within five hundred meters from the north side reaches under the direct influence or conflict in the British also in the program the silent killer we had to Finland where this concern of the health impact of radon gas the most important health impact of raid on east increased risk of lung cancer in Finland we have a total of about two thousand lung cancer cases and how George Mosse in the man who became known as the fifth Beatle change the face and sound of the music biz when I Jiri it may have Africa's largest economy but it also has an Achilles heel its reliance on the sale of oil the recent slump in oil prices slash both government revenues and the supply of foreign currency in this import hungry country latest figures showed Nigeria's economic growth is slowing the central bank has responded with currency controls the limits on how much people can stand on line in Dallas manufactures me wanna struggling because they can't import raw materials or equipment it would have to be paid for in foreign currency international monetary fund's been ramping up pressure on the Nigerian government to respond and devalue the country's currency the naira as well as cult official spending to make matters worse Nigerian oil shipments are poised to shrink to a two year low that's following the recent bombing of an underwater pipeline in the country's oil producing delta region I've been talking about that with the BBC's Martin patience in the financial capital likes well there's been an attraction on under wolves are point line in this apartment close to one of the country's biggest export terminals it's not clear who carried out thats acabou appears to be the cases and according to reports it could take two months to repair this pipeline which will put a dent in Nigeria's oil exports by about ten percent I think a big fear is that we'll see renewed militancy in the delta region and that cop production enhance a decade or so ago when the violence was at its height and this is at a time when Nigeria is already suffering with much reduced income because of the lower oil price just tell us about the effect that had on the economy and and particularly the currency the naira more than only rest on the real prank sure there's a huge amount of volatility you're goin points you have been known to eat percent of Nigeria's foreign currency earnings come from oil unease global slump in prices means does last dollars in the government coffers they get about two thirds of the Raton you from mass on what was seen he's a mad scramble on the black market for people and companies trying to get dollars I suits making it very very difficult there's a huge discrepancy between official race I'm not black market rates and dollars about fifty percent or so you know of course we got a point other manufacturers who who want to import materials except for that they need dollars that they say manufactures under our another sector of the economy that needs foreign currency that's totally wrong I spoke to one manufacturing he was having problems getting parts in for machinery has bought another businessman who says look if I can get my hands and dollars my business he's going to go to go to the wall of what what they the government is done is since last summer it's introduced measures capital controls are to trying to stem the flow of dollars out of the country how is all of this affecting ordinary people on one level it's it's quite an abstract macro economic story about foreign exchange reserves at central what does it mean for the people of Nigeria well I before ordinary people for stop but there's rising inflation it's about ten percent if you're doing business it's very difficult to get imports into the country Anand met many of the middle classes are are up in arms because they're struggling to get cash to pay for their kids educations overseas and I spoke to one mother whose son is starting at a university in the UK and she told me that the system was raped a lot of this people in government they have children approached and they will have this program doesn't house of assembly those in the Senate then definitely to have this problem influences the precedent that the vice president bill will have this program festival there only will go through the bouquet seal we seen to get there if you cannot prove that's one all even if they have to buy as a pilot market become with a forty five so this good have just seen and that's what everybody stuck I made that they want to act out the middle class the thoughts of one mother that in legos so what about the future than it is the Nigerian government going to resist all of this pressure from the international community from the likes of the IMF to devalue the naira and loosen these restrictions on foreign currency holdings on on foreign currency is are they going to stand firm on that do you think well I I mean I spoke to one top official he says yes we are going to stand firm he says devaluing will get us nowhere what we need to seize financial discipline within the Nigerian economy also spoke about his being an opportunity for knowledge here analogy is a country which imports almost everything it doesn't really have a minor fracturing base and he says this is an opportunity for knowledge earrings to make things that Nigerians knees not doing business here he's incredibly tough and some economists are warning that was slowing slowing growth potentially the country could face an economic disaster the government doesn't think that's the case but the real strains here and it still isn't clear exactly what's going to happen the disease mouse in patient speaking to me from like us was faint glimmer of hope for countries like Nigeria which rely so heavily on selling oil the cost of crude has continued to recent modest climb however only international markets over the past few hours free speech emits IG markets joins me live Chris the global a benchmark Brent crude moved back about forty dollars a barrel today what was behind that it is a bit about day after crudo we had two things really push this up was we had a American stockpile data which alert should another big built in overall crystal posted show a mashup drop in gasoline are inventors say assumption is the demand in the US is improving as one of the biggest consumers of all that would be a bullish sign on it we expect for the demand to improve to push prices up plus we had expectations or size a hope limo pick meeting in March might agree to further production freezes Abbas going some way to help in dealing with this massive oversupply we have include markets at the moment order which helped push as in energy companies Howard I think on both sides of the Atlantic in Europe and the U. S. today yes you will see that come about this but when you have a rise in crude oil prices so that does help stock markets to reserve regain some of that poise rice elsewhere two of the world's biggest banks have been told that they have to pay taxes on bonuses tell us a bit about that we keep finding scandals in banking sector has a fairly minor one of course and spirit creative accounting really to keep for bonuses with and the tax payable at down to a relatively small level and at the core was ruled by CBS and torture them caught me do that and have to pay at the tax back safe in the context of the bigger scandals we've had policies it's nothing too major beta Swisher that can help sector is still taking quite a long time right Kris thank you very much indeed that was crispy commit RG markets joining us life the main share index here in London and you the day out per modesty about a third of a percent six thousand one hundred forty six the Dow New York that's also up a third of a percent stands at seventeen thousand and twenty one currencies the yours at one dollar ten point to your sense and the pound is trading at one dollar forty two point you're listening to World business report from the BBC world service still to come nndb nndb being how the technical innovation of fifth Beatle George Martin helped transform than you first though when the motor car went into mass production in the first half of the twentieth century it was seen as the ultimate symbol of freedom and progress today though many of the world's biggest cities are struggling to cope with the number of cars on the streets the Indian capital Delhi for example the most polluted city on the planet according to the World Health Organization the engine government's been trying to restrict car use with a number of measures including a new tax the BBC show excellent my reports now from daily on the impacts because having on people's health uhhuh dnmt eighth so I don't really how dare vannatter it's nearly bedtime at the Mahajan household and five year old Cairo us parents are getting had to say a prayer she's been taught at school she has on a pink tee shirt and pajamas but before she goes off to sleep she has to take a medicine treat the CBO cough she's been suffering from it's not your regular medicine fineness Kyra has to wear a mosque attached to a machine vaporizes the drugs so that they can be released directly into her lungs and she has to do this for fifteen minutes twice a day mean reason doctor puts this on is because of the pollution in the air kairos mother anomie cuddles me she thinks the problem is getting worse repetition level seems to be rising so with every passing gill the intensity of the cost has gone up I've only gone to much to control it shouldnt Jenny's day is the worst in the world according to the WB two or the World Health Organization and the pollution is often visible usually when the sun rises and sets cloud of smoke hangs over the city as a major road junction in Delhi a traffic jam extends to where I can see I can smell the smoke in the air and as I breathe in the back of my throat feels a little bit scratchy now pollution in this city at its peak can be twenty five times more toxic than the safe level sex by the World Health Organization and why they're all different sources of pollution here scientific studies have shown that forty five percent of the most harmful pollutants come from car emissions and that's not the only reason they're so dangerous says enemy that Roy joy to read from center for science and environment it is a public health standpoint what matters most is your proximity to the social pollution city may have many sources of pollution but on a daily basis what you're most exposed to the toxic fumes coming out of the tailpipes of vehicles regular on their short and when you live close to the real site studies have shown that in Delhi if this fifty five to sixty percent of the U. seventeen million people live within five hundred meters from the north side riches under the guise it it's a zoo uncritically the British the government has been trying to put curbs only Jesus because of the city the public transport is insufficient nnj spilled into what else Daddy's mean station in the past year to try to get on it excuse already quite long it is rush off is that right people pushed around a bit jumpsuit that I am in the best hardly any place there just people don't around stories yeah no trains have been promised and Delhi minister suck danger Jen tells me they're working furiously to build transport infrastructure don't neglect your head exiled him in one year sixty percent of did even live within half a kilometer of a metro station and in the next three years we've really expect to expand public transport more substantially dnmt it's only been begun to sink in that a crisis is hanging over the city people and this has moved instant solution that was your discipline my reporting from dead heat so is the world getting any better at controlling the number of calls checking its biggest cities I'll seal stings executive director of the Brussels based system and will transport think tank transport and environment if you look at London Stockholm Amsterdam to Copenhagen to tactics there be backbone is making it more difficult to get a more expensive to get round so romanised on a congestion charge Stockholm is going to get a congestion tax I'm semi Copenhagen work with very high parking charges it's just a very expensive so if you caught me in the city so you think twice and how successful of those kinds of things being these moves have been have been very successful that the spy cam Saddam for example being a very rich city with plenty of people capable financially of owning a car car ownership is the lowest and the entire country so people just opt not to have one because it's too inconvenient and also of course because the alternatives are very convenient people are never happy with the prospect of having to pay but what was previously for free and they don't know what they're going to cats but afterwards they see what they're going to get you know they're going to get much more livable cities to going to get better alternative much more space nobody can two walk safer better equality and last but not least less congestion so essentially you you get around much faster much a people's when people have seen that they start endorsing these schemes that are initially considered draconian and big numbers we've been hearing about the health impacts of pollution from cars in a city like daily and I know that at the beginning of this year the authorities there move to a system where you are any less in vehicles without number plates on one day and vehicles with even number place on another is a system like that like you to be effective do you think well we much prefer systems that actually tackled upon of the vehicle if you have the alt even numbers time which families can Carson drive one the one they but they so it's much better to say if you have a old polluting car then you your access to the center is denied or at the very least a severely restricted that's the kind of political signal and that we need to people shift to cars that are and bacteria far less right so how impressed are you by efforts have been to make calls cleaner electric cars Hodgen because not the see that many of them out on the roads but some is that going to be part of the solution I think the big challenge for Europe at this point is to get off its diesel addiction which nobody else is following and move to an electric vehicle based industry as quickly as possible if we don't do it Silicon Valley in China will overtake us last year China sold three hundred thousand electric vehicles we all know what apple and Google and test lyra to and meanwhile we are asleep at the wheel sting's at the stable trample think tank transport and environment he was speaking to be from Brussels now you can't see it you can't smell it but radon gas is a silent killer radon is released steadily as uranium decays also cause for concern if you happen to live in a part of the world where the rocks are rich in that uranium southern Finland is one such place from where the BBC's Edwin lane reports I'm just outside the city of Tampa day here in southern Finland I'm walking through some pretty no along with talk of an esca a large ridge of rock and soil left over from the glasses that used to cover large parts of this country until the end of the last ice age and its ridges like these that I found across southern Finland that can cause a bit of a problem because they're rich in rock and soil that emits a lots of naturally occurring radon now it is in the atmosphere is not too much of a problem but what it tends to do is see incipio's houses through the foundations from the rock underneath and that causes some potentially serious health problems I love in finance nnj a my name is Marcus here along I work us building monitor for the city of dumb better we Mister around two to three hundred buildings every winter market shows me around a local school where the ventilation system has been installed specifically to stop right on accumulating just come down into the basement talk us through what's happening here this loss of big metal pipes where is the radon gas coming from as we speak and where is it going it it's collected under the building here on the roof we have two fans had pipes go under the building this building is actually pretty well done the fins of known about the raid on admitting rocks for decades but it's not just felons geology that's the problem it's also the weather one of the things you really notice when you visit Finland is how warm it feels indoors even in the middle of winter I'm in my hotel room at the moment looking at the thermostats in the wall it says about twenty degrees Celsius and thus despite the fact that if I walk out on my balcony it's absolutely freezing out here it's about minus tool minus three at the moment but it can get as low as minus thirty degrees Celsius in the depths of winter and that temperature differences because buildings here in Finland a really well designed it keeping the he thin and the cold ounce now that's great for dealing with the winter weather and keeping your energy bills down but it's a problem when it comes to raid on duty that goal climates Dunton temperature difference especially in winter time so it creates a make up the pressure into the house only home grin is from the radiation and nuclear safety authority this negative press I've sucks air from the ground and this is a test high radon concentrations and so it's only a really small air volumes it's enough to cause higher grade elements inside and it's when you expose people to high levels of radon over a long period of time that you start to see the health problems that by far most important health impact of radon is to increase risk of lung cancer and see Oberlin is professor of epidemiology at the university of Tampa in Finland we have a total of about two thousand lung cancer cases and nearly and it's been estimated that about five to ten percent of those cases would be attributable to raid on so we're talking about one hundred fifty lung cancer cases and you know back at the school inspectors like Marcus appear to have Finland's radon problem under control but the health effects of likely to show up for decades to come that report from Edwin lane in Finland they became the biggest selling music artists of all time box when the Beatles first met their producer he was none too impressed I think my music was not very good songs are pretty amateurish I was on the point of turning down except that I actually was in the studio with them for an hour and now charisma that made me feel good that that quality which is rare in that when you're with him you're happy and when you go you feel a little bit lost the voice that of George Martin who's died at the age of nineteen he produced almost all the albums the Beatles night he was a worked for the likes of sting Celine Dion the rolling stones and Elton John many believe George Martin had a profound impact on the music business among them the British television director and producer Francis Hanley he met George Martin for a BBC documentary about his life in twenty twelve I think George earned the Beatles impact on the music business is incalculable Jordan because revolutionize what you did in the studio he stops trying to correct hates with light sound wasn't like taking a snapshot of a live band it was crate sink this multi layered musical extravaganza and everyone who goes into the studio I was attacked what they did multi tracking sort of layering the mixture of classical music popular music different instrumentation I do even some sound effects and bringing in sort of found material I'm desert there's a track cool revolution number nine where they just went into into the sort of the depths of Abbey Road that found a sort of and instructional tape I think the French language type there was lesson number nine and they just took phenomenon in the late repeated at number nine number nine dnmt number nine nnj most was quite tech savvy wasn't he but for the time it was army was interesting also audio technology mark finds when you place them how you sort of arrange things in the studio when I was with us what you really want to in life is how to design aircraft you know you have that sort of stuff giddiness which I think a great purchases have to have have to be in love with the technology to be able to utilize on this issue of multi track recording to produce the lead sound that was something he he really brought to the music industry at the time wasn't it heated and it was fantastic difficult but it wasn't you know you didn't have signaled tricky sort of inventive just by using you know of flying Troxel is different tape recorders and that on tomorrow never knows had sort of like eight sleeps all beings ball going assigned rainn he had a classic didn't he went to the Guildhall school of music here in London he became a pro actional oboe player did that classical influence make yourself felt in the music he went on to produce it did I mean he was always offering thats depth of experience to the Beatles and this is why they were a marriage made in heaven because I just wanted to use any method they could to push things five they were offering George is the perfect man to office and two he could orchestrates he could suggest I mean just interesting on Elena Rick Perry strings he was sort of like he was her will give a listen to the infield music as a planet Herman and you're the guy who did sort of psycho wins and lot of Hitchcock films isa play the violin without vibrato play very harsh and that sound again it revolutionized pop music and in a way it sort of fed buckets classical music dictate revitalized husky hello so far I assume nnj Blitzer dnmt sn I think the Beatles would have actually been a success were they not to have met George Martin the patrons were debating success however projects leading the company blueprints of two of the greatest song writers you know we will have a say but my cousin Vinny Threepwood nipping as radical actors interesting and they wouldn't of flour it in the same way that they did it without George Martin after the Beatles he could sort a pick and choose who he works with and it's an eclectic bunch but interesting none the less and he just you know he would do things for fun Elton John beach boys culture club and many of the biggest names in in popular music the list goes on unserem he never stood still he was always sort of trying to do different things and trying to work to I missed immensely get people to do things for them wouldn't necessary if done for anyone else nnj I'm nndb that was the British television director and producer Francis handy arms George Martina whose dies past the age and I will leave it to the fab four who else to take us to the end of the program explicitly moments and nbsp I still can't thank all and humn pn nnj mt I love all the nndb thank you for listening to this pub because from the the world service for more download businessman the big stories and trends of the day discussed by contributors in Asia and North America I can listen to its over breakfast or on your way to
