this is world business report from the BBC world service I'm Susanna's Theresa Bangladesh claims that its account at the New York federal reserve is being hacked we haven't gotten to the bottom of the story all the New York fed is saying is that their systems have not been breached that doesn't mean there could have been a hacking from China or somewhere else downward spiral of prices in Zimbabwe why deflation is bringing the economy to a standstill I'm struck by a limited activity **** Baeza empty and most supermarkets Anuj busy is the use and on international women's day what should businesses due to enable more mothers to stay in their careers fifty percent of the world's brains are in a hundred percent of the world's women if we keep women out of the workforce are they raise their family they can get back to the workforce so we need to make it possible for them to raise their families at the same time that's all coming up that fast it's a mystery bank heist thought to involve hackers and laundered money and it's apparently taken place at the New York federal reserve the institution which processes transactions for the main U. S. central bank Bangladesh's central bank claimed on Monday its U. S. accountability access to money being stolen from it but the bank in New York has denied it systems were breached get Bangladeshi authorities claim some of the money is being traced to the Philippines and that working with anti money laundering office is that it's not known how much money is cool missing but one report suggested it could be up to one hundred million dollars but that's just one of the mystery surrounding the affair as John Coffey from Columbia Law School explain your federal reserve is probably the largest banking operation in the world it does the actual transfer of funds for the federal reserve and it's the largest such bank in the Federal Reserve System and it has presumably state of the art security I'm not suggesting that nothing could go wrong but they'd be a hard nut to crack your fire were a factor in China looking at the easiest way to get into forms none the less Bangladesh claims that its accounts at the federal reserve was hacks in the money was stolen did the central bank has been pretty vociferous and say you know this is what's happened yes the New York federal reserve has denied it systems were breached it seems as though one of the other is telling the truth we haven't gotten to the bottom of the story all the New York fed is saying is that their systems have not been breached and there's been no break down in their security that doesn't mean there couldn't of been a hacking from China or somewhere else but it does raise the tantalizing possibility that the Chinese hacker was a cover story and there is even a possibility that this could be a so called inside job with the hackers being used as simply the excuse central bank in Bangladesh says this is working with anti money laundering authorities in the Philippines what some of these funds have ended up well it could well be that they've ended up in the Philippines and that wouldn't be a surprising destination if I were in the business of money laundering at doesn't mean how they got there or that they started buying of actually went directly to the Philippines or what we want and some other method possibly with there being unauthorized withdrawal from the federal reserve and then a diversion of those forms we just haven't gone anywhere near the bottom of the story and it's a little early to try to point fingers of blame just dumb how many foreign central banks use this New York based institution simply because the dollar is basically the world's reserve currency they all would use the New York fed unless they were barred by sanctions okay so maintenance and safety at least would decide countries I don't know two hundred thirty but certainly over two hundred and anyone who uses the dollar is likely to come through the ferret because they have the largest reserves many cases of this kind before not come to my attention I don't believe it's come to light that the fed has been hacked well that was good John Coffey from Columbia Law School Zimbabwe used to be gripped by hyper inflation but knows any longer in fact instead deflation is the cpaexcel wounding the economy at the moment prices are in a downward spiral and in the absence of a sovereign currency government multi policy is severely restricted more money copy pumped into the economy through quantitative easing that we've seen in Europe or Japan for example both the cost of goods and demand falling economic activity is dropping off as the BBC's brown hungry reports now from the capital Harare deflation creatine Sirius viability challenges companies many a downsizing or shutting down all together you're running if the research how difficult is the current situation how difficult is it to operate under such condition quite quite normal activity in the in the customizing inadvertent many people come how to be postmarked lazy sort of a consumer demands yes No consumption happening at the moment but you've been in the business or the seven what is this little ailments investment which in all of these things will be super such as you can see it's an investment I don't listen to business district was a hive of business activity in the past years fifteen hundred hours here in that area up walking through the central business district I'm struck by limited activity **** Baeza empty and most supermarkets hundreds busy as they used to be in the past years stills one interesting thing to purchasing power is diminishing Zimbabwe's deflationary spiral is leading to a decrease in prices which is lowered production wages and demand reaching for the decreases in prices the United Nations estimates that more than seventy percent of the population or fourteen million leave or less than two dollars a day dnmt districts move the money vouchers used to be big business but still Zubin going down sees run directed into what is in the central business district people buying a temperatures now is compared to see about three years ago and what would be the problem if you it's different long time ago it was better than now the man knows no it's figured it in like what used to advantage Sippy deal much would you end at the moment slack for the allies flatulence when aesthetics are used to get the twenty twenty five that's the perfect I used to get very beautifully where did you grow so the civility here in this state we are not getting anything some local students as clients oblivion shopping purchasing power liquidity challenges include production it is difficult though it is very tough what what what was many legends a coalition at the moment by god's grace is just trying to make ends meet I believe so but it's I don't know what's gonna sixteen isn't so forth but nothing is moving at the moment electricity feet I find it very difficult to cope put food on the table to be able to buy items the basic items for my family irrespective of them being available in the market it's a tight situation and needs you end up resorting to difficult and desperate measures such as buying from across the borders when the purchasing power is a bit strong dnmt he could only see the history huge injection of the economy students across the central bank saved more than half a billion is Dulles was externalized debate individuals at one point two billion bay films with the country's exports only in the country two point five billion is doulas well impossible five point five billion the huge trade deficit is likely to remain when the production goes down and that was going home great reporting well Diana games is the C. E. O. of current work and a fellow at the university of Pretoria's Gordon institute of business science she told me more about the root causes of deflation in Zimbabwe generally it is about the economy is in trouble is being long period of political uncertainty about the investment climate whether the government is going to crack down on investors are already implemented its indigenous Haitian law which said at the time and that fifty one percent of companies must be a go to Zimbabweans and that really put off a lot of investors they've since reform that's flashy but they call him he's in deep trouble I mean there's a huge unemployment a lot of businesses are closing is just a very little time on the economy is really slow down so it doesn't have its own sovereign currency at the moment to what extent has the use of the dollar and other currencies will be attempted use impacted further on the deflationary spiral well I think the fact that they can print money of course the ability to print money was one of the issues that led to the huge hyper inflation it's about we head but at this stage they unable to control a monetary policy effectively because they've already got what they've got in circulation more than it has unless it is mostly the U. S. started Sir is I think that you know basically they they just conference money to have to find another way of getting money into the country could more money be available from the International Monetary Fund in the form of loans was adobe has had quite a lot of debt relief from from an organization such as the African Development Bank it is about ten billion dollars slim date and that is one of the reasons that I think the IMF is reluctant at this stage to peps rush back in because that you're somehow that it needs to be kid and I think that audiences lobby government would be reluctant pets to meet the kind of conditions that I wish would expect because they'll very strong on political sovereignty and has been quite anti what they see is developed country organization such as I am if in the pot Zimbabwe's all self reliant on mining obviously there commodities rouses hates the country pretty hard yes the government is hoping isn't it to take more money out of that industry well I think the cash the mining industry's been a cash cow for the Zimbabwe government for a very long time the mining companies have mostly stayed and now now you have a situation where the president has effectively taken back the mining rights of of the six or seven diamond mines in Zimbabwe because their licenses haven't been renewed and the government said that the diamond mines are not contributing to the government in line with the production so this court cases coming up effective yet it is a kind of nationalization of a sort but critics say that actually designs that the resources are actually declining and the government has not really made the most of their resources while they had them and you know there there's always worries that the platinum very lucrative patent mining sector might be targeted the gold mining sick takes a tracer you know the mining sector has always been very much on the government's radar when it comes to you ways of generating revenues and that was down a game CEO of maka housework it's time now to check in with the financial markets and we can speak semi car whose investment director at fidelity international hello that I think so we've had a sharp decline in exports in China what impact was that ana the financial markets well then picked his client brief despite the dramatic slump in exports exports falling twenty five point four percent in February now that is a slightly distorted figure because remember we had the weeklong Chinese New Year holiday and Fabry Richmond closed factories and Shipman scooped so it was an unflattering buys full comparison how eva and the Chinese growth is not supposed to be based on exports we know that this is an economy transitioning from export driven growth infrastructure late June driven growth to domestic demand drive is what it is a reflection of how if it is weak external Dimond the main reason for those weak exports is that international demand is falling and that is quite concerning our what's happened with the price of oil because over the last few days it was steadily rising any change today it has been very interesting because yesterday I was who will both by my benchmarks force of brain create which is the global benchmark and West Texas it intermediate crude rising pause the forty dollar a barrel and mark for the first time victory in months and hopes really spike that the twenty month price rock was coming to an end there were two reasons for this one for English production and talks between Saudi Arabia and Russia but a cotton production to die investment bank Goldman Sachs report cold water on those hopes saying that the rally in oil was premature and unsustainable and was back below forty dollars a barrel became Kerry thank you very much for giving us that update on today's move is on the markets that we give you some of the latest numbers now and in London the one hundred share index is down point nine percent at sixty one twenty five and in New York the Dow was down point two percent at seventy thousand and thirty nine now Betty Sanders and Donald Trump of Ben's winning votes in the American primaries own platforms of protectionism setting up high tariff barriers and breaking up trade agreements to safeguard jobs and both have their sights set on destroying what they called corporate cronyism I campaigns of one huge support to the surprise of the political elites in both the Republican and the democratic parties I talked to Roger Bootle managing director of capital economics and asked him what the consequences of that policies might be for the US economy I think there are some key things in common between Bernie Sanders and don't trump particular they gotta protectionism and also the role of the mega rich on wallstreet people who have done extremely well out of the existing system however if you then dive down a bit more deeply then I think you'll find that some big differences with regard to tax for instance if we got Bernie Sanders in power which I think is highly unlikely then he would presumably want to raise tax rates considerably not just on the super rich where they might be someone actually common ground with Donald Trump but more generally Bristol trump is talking about quite radical tax cuts varies a real difference between the Republican and the Democrats as far as these two candidates a consultant I suppose you could say that this is a sign of a healthy political system actually by contrast with what been true in Britain for many many years and I see many countries in Europe others a real debate going on with some really strange however I think both of them frankly tease a technical term are off the wall vases full expenditure increases the pearly Sanders wants to push through would require some hefty increases in taxes which would then I think his incentives quite heavily meanwhile for don't trump it's back to the old imaginary world filled measure Republican world if you cut taxes tomorrow much you cut taxes the review rolls in and eventually you end up getting in more tax than you started with well is a point at which that may work but frankly I think not on the skeletal trumps talking and Tampa it also seems to be running pretty full throttle on an anti immigration platform in a real protectionist platform well if we've got this sort of policy introduced I think it would potentially be extremely damaging and not just in America because it could set off a protectionist war across the world is one thing we know about Donald Trump it surely that if he were to gain power he wouldn't be implementing what he's been talking about over the last several months he count is balmy once he's got that nomination I fully expect him actually to take back to the more reasonable level of expectation hold try to garner votes from the center so I think one shouldn't take too seriously many of the things that she's been saying so far do you think that this attack on crony America crony corporate America will continue from both trump and as well Saunders is concerned in the the next few primaries up against Hillary Clinton I hope that it will continue in the sense that I think is very healthy one of them major failings of the capitalist system not just in America but in lots of other countries in recent years has been the ludicrously high level of rewards earned by various corporate executives not just tumble streets or in the city but actually the corporate sector more generally without I think any fundamental justification so anything that would address that is healthy whether actually moving could reasonably be down with all the usual precious I very much doubt refer start if we go to Hillary Clinton presidency and it's still likely that the Republicans will control both houses of Congress in which case it's a recipe for a stalemate and I doubt very much in those seconds the great too could be achieved is that of economista Recep it'll you're listening to the BBC world service the world's radio station and special good evening to Allison is on ninety one point nine FM in Spain's Costa del sol relays on talk radio Europe for more than a hundred years international women's day has been celebrated around the world during that time there's been rapid progress for the March of female emancipation at the ballot box and in the workplace but still the size he remains unequal with women behind on pay promotion and in many parts of the world education an estimated two hundred and fifty million adolescent girls live in poverty worldwide unable to raise the income in the future to establish more prosperous lives but there are now plenty of organizations trying to change that the spring accelerated program provides finance men tools and technical expertise to improve the lives of girls in parts of Africa and Asia I talk to Rebecca colder from spring and she told me more about the programs work I think girls aspirations have changed because I think they're more aware of what the opportunities are there are out there for them and so I think it's a it's a case of of understanding what girls aspirations are and how they're involving and supporting them to achieve those aspirations what do you do as part of the spring accelerated program to help them do just that I'm we support businesses in East Africa and were about to him launch in South Asia and we support businesses that have the potential to change girls lives I'm either through reaching grosses customers are beneficiaries or there including girls I'm in their value chains as managers running microphones highs is a sales agents or is actually producing goods and services and I think we can hear from a number of the girls and young women who have been part of the accelerated program in Uganda right now leann rimes firm control throughout the life skills lessons reproductive business skills we taught them how to see learn how to speak for themselves my name is more lucrative I'm sixteen years old taping sailor maybe definitely has again beautiful feel great until cellular phone eighteen years old animal shelter manager of religion and the best things online market any customer care record keeping seems if I get to know that everything I know the soap off and I'll be a dismissal so Rebecca unknown of inspiration that coming from those girls and a lot of aspiration but still two hundred and fifty million adolescent girls live in poverty worldwide what kind of challenges do they face as they're born as a girl into a family they start facing the challenges of of not getting preferential treatment in the Homeboys are often preferred in terms of accessing health care in terms of feeding practices in terms of education you know and I say as they you know approach adolescence there's a hole in a range of different different challenges that they have to face around just staying in school arm around having to do way more work in the household than their brothers do I'm early marriage early childbearing so that by the time they get to nineteen as the transitioning into womanhood they faced a huge range of different all obstacles which have knocked them back in life how important is it for the girls that you work with that they have role models to follow it's it's really important and it's a really difficult difficult thing to program around you know girls are getting inspiration from can or can't get inspiration from a whole range of different sources in everything from sort of friends and older sister stuff other women in the community who've started businesses or who pursued their education and you can also doing sort of more formal ways through actual mentorship programs you know things around like that what the girl guides do which is providing a safe space for girls and mentors and a really good life skills curriculum that's also a really important way to reach girls and that was Rebecca colder from the spring organization one woman viewed as a role model in terms of professional achievement is lady Barbara judge she's currently the chairman of the UK's institute for directors and as an adviser to the board of tech co the Tokyo electric power company aisles Ty wet her work ethic came from really it's all about my mother when I was young when I think when everybody's young they always ask little children what you want to be when you grow up so when I came home saying I want to be an actress my mother said we are not having any starving actresses in this family if you want to act you can often for the jury going be a lawyer now my mother was really interesting woman because in the fifties she taught a course at NYU called the world of work for women and what did she teach the women in the fifties she taught them to wear white gloves which meant dress appropriately write a CV which nobody ever heard of in those days and answer the ads even though they said man walked because her theory was that at the end of the day a man looking for somebody to work for them and seen so many boring and not so smart man and find one smart women he'd hire you had your mother's voice in your area giving you that work ethic if young women don't have that where else can they get that inspiration from one of the reasons I talk to young women whenever people ask me to is because I think all of us who are older and have been through it we owe it to young people to be role models to talk to them to try to inspire them to be the best that they can be somebody has to tell them it's possible how did you manage to achieve such professional success and raise a family as well because that is a real struggle it is a real struggle I think two things were lucky for me and my mother who was there again saying suicide he told you had to be there from when the baby is born to the age of one to three it was important for the baby I mother tell me it wasn't didn't matter that if I wanted to keep working that when a baby was born it needed to be fed diapered and based and you can get an eighteen year old girl to do that your job is to get a good one go and work and make the money and I said but mom if I can eighteen on call to do that the baby will think that she's the mother my mother said no Barbara a baby doesn't forget their mother it's just one more person to live what you have to do is when you are with your child be there a hundred percent of the time undivided attention but it doesn't have to be there all the time the world is changed a lot and it's hard to get childcare harder than when I was young actually that the government and employers have to help it's this point we have to have a policy starting from the top providing good childcare providing flexible working providing tax incentives that help mothers who have to pay for who have to work and pay for childcare my own opinion is that childcare should be tax deductible just deductible against your income so that you can go to work because society cannot afford to lose its smart women the childcare we have subsiding needs all that brainpower you know fifty percent of the world's brains are in a hundred percent of the world's women if we keep women out of the workforce for five or ten years while they raise their family they can get back to the workforce so we need to keep them in it and make it possible for them to raise their families at the same time and the helper like my mother was a helper to me in terms of giving me the I'm emotional security to have my child be with of helper is that the government and the companies have to me be like my mother and say it's fine to work from home technology so different from when I was young you can sit at your desk at home with your child right next to you and be participating in a conference call and nobody knows where you are and that was lady Barbara judge that his also held the positions of commission at the securities and exchange commission in the U. S. and the head of the UK's atomic energy you've been listening to world business report on the BBC world service with me Susanna's Teresa if you went to comment on anything email us well talk business happy BC talk to you can thank you for listening to this pub because from the BBC world service for more download business matters well the big stories and trends of the day are discussed by contributors in Asia and North America you can listen to its over breakfast or on your way to work fineness
