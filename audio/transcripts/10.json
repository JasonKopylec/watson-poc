S. was going to do towards Asia but I think that it does make sense in this point in the elections that the focus is on the domestic economy there\u0027s a lot of concerns about the living standard of middle class Americans fatty sort of stagnating and the impact on jobs of global trade the concern for the rest of the world is that the IMF is been saying recently global trade is slowing down and it\u0027s a problem and that they won\u0027t policymakers to get involved and the U. S. just when people right now Elaine is absolutely right I mean this is catering to a deep concern of the United States that living standards have not been rising for a vast stretch of the electorate odd that has seen their jobs move abroad up or has just been disrupted by the digital economy however it does have an effect on the global economic outlook if the world is looking at negative interest rates in Japan negative interest rates in Europe stagnating economies in both any United States that might be retrenching to its own shores a politically and even if some of that language results in actual policy you\u0027ll see further slowdown globally in the economy "
