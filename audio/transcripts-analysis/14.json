turning a blind eye to Turkey's crackdown on the media Turkey has Europe over a barrel right now the overwhelming politically Xing your price now is a refugee crisis and the only way to get those numbers to it's a strike a deal Turkey Beijing says that won't be a hard landing as it unveils a new lower growth target but just how reliable on its numbers is a gap between I think what's happening on the ground and what the government says it's happening in it and its figures unfortunate because they continue to set hi growth targets that gap I think will assist and you've got mail the inventor of the apt symbol has dies we find out how is who began in nineteen seventy one I was busily trying to find things to use this new fangled network for night heard about a proposal to send messages to be printed with the printer and stuffed away in mailboxes for people to read and you can have more of that archive interview with email Pinay ray Tomlinson coming up that fast Turkey's over the European Union more help in stemming the flood of refugees but it wants more money and fast track accession talks in return discussions of being taking place among EU leaders in Brussels where prime is stuck up at davuto lu said Ankara would take back all non Syrian migrants and crackdown Honda when people smugglers that it wants concessions in return including quick a visa free travel for its citizens Herkules for Europe's leaders to strike a much harder bargain and speak out against on car is increasingly authoritarian behavior the criticism has intensified the Turkish authorities seized the control of design on newspaper lace on Friday jealous were physically removed from the building as police fire tear gas and water cannon to disperse thousands of demonstrators Hardenberg can police tightened security outside the Istanbul office is this the crowd continued to protest one of them said seizure of the newspaper it was tyranny unions fear in the villains in your pajamas nobody can impact of such a cruel measuring any part of the world where in the world if you seen this tear any before this didn't happen even when Hitler was in power let alone Turkey even the incidents going on in Syria not this much better Christmas wreath good so you son is in many settlements indebted and we're all humans after all and every human being matches different opinion should be voiced in a society that's my opinion a single voice does not mean anything therefore we came here to show different voices and to support salmon newspaper we are sorry this is not the country we are longing for we are concerned I stayed to the Financial Times added set in stumble mojo shifts tostada who told me that the we can take a vote was expected this was a crackdown that had been expected for quite some time drugs government admitted very clear president era wanted me to very clear that he was unhappy with newspapers like someone that he ties to a Islamic imam who lives in Pennsylvania and is now considered a sworn enemy of the president Osmond's bosses who had interviewed three months ago I'm story warning about this were very clear this is gonna happen to them do you think the urgency railway out with how you leaders want to resolve the migrant crisis is meaning that's perhaps are taking a softer stance against encore than they otherwise would undoubtedly it's been very clear to Turkish officials that this is a time when the European needs it the most and they have been back paddling being softer even ignoring some of the excesses you seen in Turkey and there was a report that the European Union was was released in October which would be critical of the way that the Turkish judiciary has been behaving the way the church government has been overstepping its bounds in that report was delayed until after November elections that's something that came up in conversation between senior EU officials and the president as a reminder that they were also bending over backwards to stop any outside criticism from affecting his electoral prospects however the German foreign minister has said said today that they will be bringing up this issue of with that Turkey's prime minister during those talks and they are taking this seriously they will take it seriously into the bringing it up and talks but as a couple of Turkish officials and selecting dimmer Taj you drove the big Kurdish party here's HTP have told me Turkey has a Europe over a barrel right now the overwhelming politically Xing your right now is a refugee crisis and the only way to get those numbers down strike a deal Turkey Turkish officials understand that joining the European Union is a long and complicated process but right now you can get concessions that they need which includes billions of euros to help them pay for the cost of taking care of some two point seven million refugees and Turkey visa free travel for Turkey's our citizens to the European Union and to some extent perhaps a get out of jail free card for some of these actions that have taken among the colleagues that you work with and those other publications in Turkey is that a real sense of unease at the moment with some on one has to remember is that it saved far more complicated issue than just press freedom as a newspaper that has been aligned with the group that's involved in a political and a long running dispute with the government and previously was very loyal to the government they had a falling out in the middle of the little twenty thirteen but this other newspapers including one Kalju ingredients which means Republic it's incredibly old newspapers very well respected and the two editors of the newspaper had been jailed for over ninety days while awaiting trial and that wasn't who she used to stop off from the Financial Times in Istanbul China faces a difficult battle ahead the words of premier Li cho Chang at the nation's annual parliamentary me sing the national people's Congress which began on Saturday Beijing is lowered its growth will cost a six and a half percent for the coming year and it faces some tough questions overt stewardship of the world's second largest economy and its financial markets if the average Chinese person does what the government has to say I have any impacts when a reporter Danny Vincent was outside the Congress anti today I'm standing on the corner of charm and having you in central Beijing across the road I can see the people's Congress building it's China's parliament when legislators meet just once a year inside is a celebration of Chinese democracy sorts more than three thousand delegates sits in these wide holes setting the agenda on the nation's policies but it's often seen as a rubber stamp parliament decisions in China a made behind closed doors well ok you don't have a lot in the tiny street on the outskirts of Beijing stands a small open markets surrounded by skyscrapers and scaffolding traders listen to nationalistic pop music while sending their goods China is changing all around them here business over the last few months has been slowing nearby magma in the savings and unemployment business isn't so great but the standard of living is definitely better than it once was the food retailer clothes we wear are definitely better than before I think that what the delegates presented strong Chinese parliament will be good for ordinary people the traders here Olczyk memorial and patriotic this is what the Communist Party because capitalism with Chinese characteristics adequate amounts of was a muzzle on the ground them dollar hundred students whatever direction the Chinese Communist Party points is to we follow it whatever the Chinese Communist Party does must be correct it has been years since mounts a doomed one as this country we just want to make a living if we can eat well and drinkwell with satisfied sitting in a chair unknown watching his school is Mr pan a pensioner who fully supports the policies of the Communist Party so ruin your question that should they mean that they are so similar Cuba after the thirteen five year plan everyone in China should be able to live a wealthy life like the small business last year oil and thirty thousand dollars it's good will my children work the state owned companies life is getting better observers say the Chinese economy is overt you a change so it must move away from its reliance on exports and manufacturing but it must also keep up with huge expectations from Chinese people and the rest of the world when it was done even supposing that to meet the new growth figures the five year plan being unveiled at the Congress includes targets on energy consumption job creation and inflation but analysts say details are pretty sketchy and there's a promise to overhaul the bloated state sector by bringing in the private companies to help run station films that dominate industries across banking telecoms oil and stale not Williams's chief Asia economist with capital economics I asked him how hard the target of six and a half percent will be to achieve I think it's very unlikely that in reality China will grow anything like the six Nov seven percent target the government has said himself I think most analysts of China's economy will tell you that last year for example the economy didn't grow as fast as the government said it it there's a gap between I think what's happening on the ground and what the government says is happening in in its figures unfortunate because they continue to set his high growth targets that cap I think will assist the country's chief economic planner has said that China won't experience a hard landing do you think that's possible given thus says the authorities opposes that they've really got it popped out on these zombie firm somebody takeout all this up over capacity how will the economy be able to cope with that well etcetera very difficult transition lies ahead over the next few years as you say there's a lot of companies that are not making any money that they they need to be closed down workers later he moved to other parts of the economy but I think it is possible for that to happen without there being a hard landing because Chinese policymakers unlike many in the west for example still have quite a lot of room to stimulate their economy to can cut interest rates further they can loosen fiscal policy and in fact that's where public agency of the next few months I was safe with a message recall from Beijing this weekend now you touch tone fiscal policy a little earlier because I the authorities have said that we're going to earmark money to fund tax cuts do you think this is more evidence of this continued shift towards more consumption and thus saving here this is a positive developments I have the past few years normally when the Chinese government was to stimulate to monitor spot to say by trying to stimulate more investment get the bank's lending more and so on and not says has fueled this issue of over investment that we see throughout the economy yeah estrogen is more based on tax cuts I think could be very effective typically if those tax cuts go to poorer households people were more likely to spend a lot of money that could do a lot said to Bustamante mutt Williams from capital economics let's check in now with the financial markets have we can speak to Jamie that same call from stockbrokers Charleston is with me now I know that Jarod said what impact his will Beijing being sang had only will price well it's very hard to suit entangle our ports been going on with your price which is essentially frankly being driven by very aggressive show covering by which I mean speculators who had previously sold exposure are in anticipation of the price would go down a now covering that bets on this is causing uninterested squeeze in the price which is driving it higher so that's what's happening does it bear any relation to what's happening in the real world as the reports are quite brightly certain you requesting to can China achieve that six to help Simpson growth rate highly debatable not survive Chinese economist from becoming somewhat less than that there is some scope for fiscal policy easing as well as mum triple seizing what about the world economy his to be teetering on the edge of a global recession and there is still the substantial supply demand did secular print that exists and has not yet been addressed for all the talk we can recounts about production cuts as time with oil shall we had today's pays off its historical debts to the national Iranian oil company which seem to be hampering there comes a time to get back into the country how significant is this do you thing I think is extremely significant Sir this is a residual one point seven seven billion euros a one point four billion pounds it relates to previous unpaid deliveries of oil service money that shell has owned the effects of the Iranian government for quite sometime escorted out the way it's got out the way very quickly and therefore in what will doubtless be a race to participate in the rebuilding of Iranian infrastructure I'm sure so would like to play a key policy not and just very briefly let's talk about EDF the French energy giant it Sam Shepard's has fallen over the resignation it's fun lunch finance officers chief financial officer was this is all about said the costs of further developing Hinkley point these are some set nuclear power station I which is going to cost the ETF very substantial amounts of money is going to have to raise death you know it's to do this essentially under the very bottom line he has resigned over government policy which said remains in relation to that first generation and to the utilities sector jamboree somewhat unusual interesting academies bats account many thanks said the latest numbers for you in London the one hundred share index is down point three percent at sixty one eighty two and in New York the Dow is up point three percent seventeen thousand and fifty five you're listening to well business report from the BBC world service still to come DC Callaway tells us about the office pranks of her friends he had to wear a red to draw under a white shut the office the next day and then take off his jacket during a client meeting and why Morton corporate culture now frowns at practical joke it's limbo time in Spain in more ways than one it's two months since the election but still no government is being formed and now the bar is set for another deadline Spain's political parties will have two months more to form a new administration otherwise fresh elections we cooled guy has got reports now on the deadlock from Madrid a lot of them got me that'll be interpreting that you know what hundred thirty one votes in favor and two hundred nineteen against a resounding defeat editor Sanchez and the first time in Spain's democratic era the candidate for prime minister has lost this parliamentary because vote the ramifications a headline news in Spain this is also the first time Spain has had such a fragmented parliament the arrival of two relatively new parties podamos and sue that analysts have shaken up an electoral system that had been dominated by the socialists and the conservative popular party for more than three decades Mister Sanchez formed a pact with the liberal Susanna's party but that wasn't enough to win the fight no party came even close to getting a majority in the election meaning power and now essential out here on the streets of Madrid people seem to have a mixed opinion about all this the two main parties that we had in Spain it during the last ten years have stolen a lot of money from the population so I think it's positive to have two new parties I think it's great that we have new parties because people are more efficiency parties themselves have been quick to blame each other for the deadlock in January marry under a hallway the popular party's prime minister rejected king Phillip has invitation to try to form a new government saying he didn't have enough support in parliament despite winning the most number of votes cast by the public it's popular party wanted to form a so called grand coalition with the socialists and silanis but Mister hoy has become increasingly isolated in recent weeks Kuralt by corruption scandals apparently without any potential governing partners whole ceremony Garcia and then this is a member of parliament for the popular party the uncertainty and then next ability coming out of the process course poses several questions on the economy and that's what we are trying to push the sausage before these precognition and that's why we made such a generous offer some of the other opposition parties have said that's the problem hail a problem here is Marianna Hoyt a prime minister and he should step down not woods perhaps help the situation do you think you're the leader of your party should step down all that might make things easier not at all and from our side that we said that the problem that way perasaan to the leader of the Socialist Party although he could have been part of the solution keys the problem hockey's yes Putina a blockade on the whole situation but see that analysts which ones to modernize the economy and clamp down on corruption see Siniora hallway is anything but the solution Antonio roll down is the party spokesman on economic affairs I don't think that directoy can actually you you're going to be ambitious you going to be really committed to this change and that only the political party of Mister hoy the popular party has huge felons interpretive corruptions the entire thing we can support the holy as a leading fee if you go to to these big transition that we expect to have in this country if there is no government by early may fresh elections will be called meanwhile the until Sterrett he pulled animals says it wants to form a coalition of the left with the socialists and other small a leftist parties pull them as his fiery leader properly list yes says he cannot work with ciudadanos he says has neo liberal economic policies last year Mister Iglesias gave king Felipe it as a gift a box set of game of thrones TV show full of political intrigue trail suggesting the monarch might learn something from it with Spain's political scene frozen by lack of consensus he might be right so I hedge Carol forcing that you're listening to the BBC world service the world's radio station and it's a special good evening to our listeners on digital short wave of DRM in India and five point eight four five megahertz hi yeah Khalil fashioned not never said this ten years ago but when a long chassis email pains into my inbox it's now quite quite in an era when life changing moments I shared on social media long and detailed updates via email to become few and far between despite the competition amazed offices that and a treatment is still the way to do business it's injuring legacy for its inventor American ray Tomlinson who's died aged seventy four he's credited with putting the sign in the addresses of the revolutionary system back in nineteen seventy one Heraeus speaking on national public radio's All Things Considered program in nineteen seventy one I was busily trying to find things to use this new fangled network for I heard about a proposal to send messages to be printed with the printer and stuffed away in mailboxes for people to read and I said these messages should go to computers and so I thought about it for a bit and then decided to put together a system that might do that and so you you were just kind of doing this on your own nobody said Hey at ray can you invent a email in the statement of work did not say thou shall go go forth and invent email but we were working on ways to which humans and computers could interact and try to improve that interaction do you remember what your first email said well everybody asks that course I don't remember every single word of it the main thing is there were lots of test messages here these things don't work out of the box because there was no box every time you test you have to generate some kind of a message and you might drag your fingers across the keyboard or just type the opening phrase from Lincoln's Gettysburg address or something else so technically the first email is completely forgettable and therefore forgotten footage your first message go to all the text messages were sent to myself I had to computers that were literally side by side keyboards are about ten feet apart and I could wheel my chair from one to the other type a message and one and then go to the other and see what I tried to send now why did you pick the Exxon this iconic symbol hadn't you pick that simple you know certainly wasn't an icon back in nineteen seventy one but it was a key on the keyboard that did not appear in users names not appear and host names it made sense it's off the proposition it means user apt post that is the only proposition on the keyboard so did you become a internet billionaire from us no I do not a billionaire today not not by several more hours a magnitude hundreds hundreds of millions know I've often thought about what fraction of a cent per at side would it take to make me very comfortable and this is not is a very small fraction so ray Tomlinson I do you feel comfortable with the title ray Tomlinson inventor of email yeah you can call me that and that's ray Tomlinson inventor of the email who died on Saturday aged seventy four now how many giggles do you get through journey average working day laughter in the office is apparently becoming a serious business on regular commentator DC carried the Financial Times says office pranks allow a rat breach in an era of political correctness Evita the other day a journalist colleague told me how recently he had sneaked up to a work mates unattended computer and fires off a message to the man's male boss that sad I can contain my feelings for you no longer what struck me most about this story was not baby Ashton us but that such behavior has become an anachronism how do you anyone plays pranks like this at work anymore my generation used the thrive on such things but is mostly grown out of them I colleague accepted well the younger generation has failed to grow into them and acquaintances upon us a little fun tells me that young lawyers areas prank phobic as young Janice the source of JP and his peers engaged and his associates in the nineteen nineties and now inconceivable he'd tell me how he once lost a bet with another lawyer as a result of which he had to wear a red raw under a white check to the office the next day and then take off his jacket during a client meeting last week I hunted down some of the graduate trainees who have been at the Financial Times for a year or so how many practical jets and they played all had sprung on them what kind of cost not only was the onset none but they appear not to understand the question is this some fashion to pranks that defines millennials far more than any of their other suppose it characteristics and it's easy to understand why they feel if they do for stars employers have made all of us more politically correct normal rule bound and more faint stand by five hundred page codes of conduct more than corporate culture takes a dim view of pranks seeing them as bullying or is harassment more than most young people of land that there's no such thing as a private joke on email only idiotic old people think there is and then life is becomes a much more competitive my generation slipped into jobs and never felt any particular need to behave in a professional fashion except when strictly cold full by contrast any twenty five year old he's made it into a big corporate job has hacked to excel academically climb Kilimanjaro start a couple of charities place semi professional viola and have taught themselves how to because it baby ish pranks simply don't fit the profile get the most powerful reason is that young professionals do not think it's okay to pretend to be someone else online one of them explained to me that that internet personas as so much a part of them the whole lives are online then it counts is a serious betrayal if anyone especially a colleague tries to mess with that still the death of the prank strikes me as a terrible shame office work is relentless and I just look at someone else's expense can share one out now and great pranks does want bullies they knew how to do it with just enough affection that even the victim wasn't Scott for very long when I was new at the FDA in nineteen eighty five one colleague and particularly used to delight and phoning me from the other side of an open plan office pretending to be an enraged chief executive from the company I'd written about complaining that my article was full of mistakes I would start her own blush my colleague and his friends would waltz vastly amused alright mortified I eventually saw the funny side I repaid the pranks that by marrying him our fun loving correspondent Lucy Callaway from the Financial Times and if you still love pranks at work tell us about them by emailing us thanks ray Tomlinson the address is well thought business at BBC dot co dot UK but if that's too old fashioned contact us on Twitter at BBC well bears or me Sousa's Theresa from all of us here goodbye there are many ways to keep up with the BBC world service join us on social media or sign of a pot costs and BBC world service dot com slash part because ",
