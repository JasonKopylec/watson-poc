    "text": "this is world business report from the BBC world service I'm Susanna Theresa tucking agrees to stop the flow of migrants into Europe in return for more Asian visa free travel for it citizens across the EU we're only actually fear an influx appropriately with visa free travel because in Turkey also we have higher welfare we have higher growth rate dishonour sag whipping South Africa do the Guptas exec too much influence over government they have a widespread of businesses someone listed some are not but the common thread seems to be that there is a link with the south African government somewhere along the line and why keeping it local keeps the presses rolling something a little bit magical going on that was still going and we still find ways of sticking in Barcelona hoping all and it's one of Britain's major status and its print run we find out how that tiny newspaper stays in business but fast Turkish authorities have intercepted hundreds of migrants trying to reach the Greek island of Lesbos in a major operation involving ships and helicopters the drive to stop them reaching Europe's borders came as EU leaders clinched a deal with Ankara to halt illegal migration the president of the European Council Donald to six that there was unanimous agreement between Turkey and the twenty eight nation bloc we agreed that all irregular migrants coming from thirteen to Greek islands from the Sunday the twentieth of March will be returns to third the implementation to be phased in gradually based on the so called wild for awhile principle on a more general note some may think that if agreement is a silver bullet but the already small conflicts it is just one pill of the European Convention strategy fans can work only if the other bill last fall also implement when in return it's believe Turkey has won concessions on the acceleration of its bid for EU membership the doubling of refugees today seven billion dollars and visa free travel for Turkish citizens across the EU by June earlier Turkish president recipe type Adwan said his country was already bearing a much bigger share of the burden than Europe yeah virtualize consume Mucha it's a time when Turkey is hosting a three million refugees those who are unable to find space for a handful of refugees who were in the middle of Europe keep these innocents and shameful conditions must first look at themselves well the deal reached today marks a radical shift of tactics of the year in which more than a million people entered the EU by crossing the sea from Turkey to the Greek islands she denies is the secretary general of the economic development foundation a research organization specializing in European a fast paced in Istanbul I asked her how easy the agreement would be to implement I think there is a question mark there because the EU has previously agreed to accept their quota you couldn't fulfill his because several of the member states objected to accepting this again so now it would be unrealistic to expect that now the EU or the member states would agree the taken refugee so it will still be made the only countries like Germany take in more refugees but there is also a problem in Germany that the public opinion inserting a yes there is a huge situation are taking the mortgagee so I think it's quite difficult the but of course when you exchange of refugees is agreed by the two sides maybe it makes her key to more easily accepted readmission agreement one very controversial because of the stale as far as many European citizens fail is the fact that they will be visa free travel for Turkey citizens across Europe and already many fair that that could put undue pressure on that countries on their services if the borders effectively open to many more people here it has created a lot of controversy further could still Turkey has to fulfill a number of criteria you test because low there are a lot of cultural beautiful mansions that Turkey has exits approved and certified also there are some obligations like strengthening its border management system so there's a whole social criteria that Turkey has a full field I think the either deal will depend on the what impact do you think this visa globalization will have on economic relations between Turkey and the European Union I think it will have a criteria goodness sakes because now we have a customs union and they are also in the process of starting to negotiate the modernization of the customs union and it's also the name of the services sector the one you talk about services in a force prenatal month is the a very important part of it is because people are the service providers I think if you we can also attained the free moments especially for sharp from federal to hang an area I think this will bring it to her contact between Serbs and the European Union it's important to note though is nice that's they says for tourists ready it's not for as you say services people to work in the services industry isn't workin companies across Europe many European systems fail is that the free movement of people has gone too far and if that is affecting wage growth in individual countries yeah I mean this is a very important point I do not forget people to go and settled in the EU itself for short term to use to get business purposes for example for a business person to engage in a business deal test for the short term Chang MD but equally should also published a report on the impact that is likely to result from this if he's a liberalization and in the company's assessment was that there is no need to actually fear an influx of proficiency with visa free travel because in Turkey also we have higher welfare we have higher growth rate we will not see the experience the expected flu migration flow from Turkey I think in the dealer will not really has a major impact on migration well it was GM announced on the economic development foundation in Istanbul is a powerful business family in South Africa too close for comfort to the government his claim that the Guptas siblings who and interests across many industries exit so much influence over president Jacob Zuma that they even give out ministerial jobs that does have denied the accusations and in parliament the president denied that appointments have been influenced there is no minister who is here was ever appointed by the group does or by anybody else Mister president you and your family I didn itself while south Africans I get to import a lot and losing weight but south Africa's last white president activity to clock said president Zuma's actions were threatening democracy fact is this do much nepotism fact is this too much corruption fact is they still much favoritism and a black elite has grown I asked him cover an editor of south Africa's business day newspaper to tell me more about the group to family they all three brothers who came to South Africa from India about so fifteen years ago there are now seventeen citizens or they've taken outside African citizenship but they are engine origin hello grounds all that for the claims that they exacts political power because pulse of this is due to that incident back in December when the finance ministers resigned to well replaced in quick succession this is a very disputed issue of course they deny you know being involved in any kind of cronyism in South Africa or influencing the political system in any way but there's a lot of evidence that is building the tsa refutes that and over the past week the most serious charge has you're just exploded Southwark nobody talk it all started ready with a passing comment you know a report in the Financial Times which suggested that members of the family had time off with the job of the finance minister to the deputy finance minister the deputy finance can sustain this instant the jobs and just before that incident when the finance ministers changed last year late last year the family initially dismissed the claim out of hand butts so after being signed for a long time the deputy finance minister did acknowledge that it did happen this week and as a consequence a series of other people in government have made similar claims and I understand that the former balsa south Africa's state power firm has become one of the latest figures to accuse this family of having ties with that the president yeah you know the modus operandi seems to be Morris saying the family's interest involved in doing business with these states organizations in one way or another they have a widespread of businesses that are huge they own a newspaper they own you know uranium what must we coal mine some interests in no military defense so it's a very wide ranging set of businesses summer listed from a not but that the common thread seems to be that there is a link with the south African government somewhere along the line another Cup his have rejected all of these claims saying that the victims of a plot have they given any more details about what kind of plot you know they're just saying that these are tapes to smear them that this is an attempt to restrictive business activity I mean the most obvious link is serving with the presidency one of the its name is a dishonest emojis formally a partner in almost all of the business ventures in one way or another we know that they have done business with other members of the president's family too but it is only seems to be the main partner and he is we think representing Zeba plans a whole nother body parts the ANC has said today that the relationship between Jack exam and the group does it mean has not been on the agenda as a meeting of the party's leadership today to think they're really trying to downplay with these accusations there's a huge **** within the ANC about the links between party members and business in general and to this seems to be the most egregious case and within the agency's meeting this weekend they claim books so the issue is not going to addressed specifically but there are dozens we say of NC in various capacities have expressed concern about this really right to the top so it it Kitty is something that is Sir dividing the party Tim Keown from business day you're listening to wealth is this report from the BBC world service still to come the value of business degrees in a sense the system that rewarded that kind of investment in an MBA is if not broken at least antiquated that's all coming up that time not to check in with the financial markets and a little alley I spoke to just below a from CMC markets who told me what the movie is well on the London exchange it's been that they have to hops in a way we started off a little lackluster but we had some some words from the European central bank suggesting that they may cut interest rates further so that was an interesting one that supported sentimental little bit standard chartered was the biggest rise on the day banks have been suffering a bit recently so this was a short covering I think you could say the same about sports direct which was also a big Raisa they're about to be demoted from the thirty one hundred down to defeat see two fifty seven a few people getting out of their short positions that you talked about the urban central bank indicating that interest rates might full further that benchmark race and that's quite interesting because alter the initial announcement of facts in large program of quantitative easing Mario Draghi a pitch to indicate that they wouldn't be a fan of the cot well quite exactly and I think that's what we're seeing now is the ECB are trying to address the concern that we saw in markets writes after that whereby the euro jumped in European stocks fell he's trying to say what actually nine we've not run out of tools here that the tool box is still full we can cut interest rates further we need to and they've also raise the idea of this helicopter money which is literally paying money to the to the public in order to spur growth a barrel of Brent crude ticked up above forty dollars a barrel today what is pushing the price upwards place to fact Israeli that the price of the U. S. dollar has been slumping after the federal reserve failed to to raise interest rates as many had suspected and obviously oil is denominated in dollars but the other big thing is that we have produces both OPEC and non OPEC producers like Russia setting up for a meeting in April where they may discuss freezing out put in obviously it's been the oversupply of oil which has been a big downwards factor on it and say the fact that supply may be cut back a bit is is supporting prices hospital of MCNC markets while in London the one hundred share index was down point two percent at sixty one ninety and in New York the Dow is up point five percent at seventeen thousand five hundred and sixty it's that time of the week now will meet back at just some of the stories of the past week nnova is former president Lula da Silva has been blocked by the courts from taking a job in his successes government or get a political crisis got an economic crisis we got what some people call a moral crisis because of corruption is a very delicate moment for pn a new global Britain and Germany agree search for what they're trying to do is trips do most of Marcus Steve Jobs mark Zuckerberg that old college dropouts now one of the business green graduate degree if you could make it to the top of the business world without one reality is is that it top program like Colombia's the opportunities that are open would not otherwise be so Brazil's former president is appointed chief of staff despite being involved in a corruption probe a mega mergers agreed between the London Stock Exchange and on each of us and MBAs business masters degrees left the cost and hauled workload to disclose issues I spoke to and the Canary senior international editor at The New York Times within Paris and Mary child's U. S. financial correspondent of the Financial Times in New York and I began by asking and if she thought the mass protests in Brazil well understandable absolutely I mean if you look at Brazil from outside of Brazil you say to yourself oh it's a it's a corruption scandal it's resource base this was inevitable so much money sloshing around the business but if you're in Brazil this is an existential cry Brazilians have been accustomed thinking of themselves or at least since about twenty ten when Lula when he was president declared that this was going to be the Brazilian century and the country was going to be on the upsurge taking its place among world powers did Brazilians believed it and there was no reason not to because well prices were rising Petrobras was the sixth biggest company in the world now it turns out that if these these probes are finding anything they're finding that this success might have been based on a massive fraud so it's not surprising that you're seeing people the streets not surprising you're seeing your reaction it's almost it's almost visceral most personal Mary child's eve been following this story it's a real full from grace's net for Brazil gates no surprise railway that these corruption allegations have have affected them deeply absolutely I think the point about the optimism and and then that being reversed that's huge I think that can't be overstated the IMF is predicting that Brazil's economy will contract by almost eight percent between January and beginning a twenty fifteen in the end of this year and I think that that's such a reversal you know from a country that that you know wanted to host the Olympics in a country that felt so much optimism just a few short years ago I think that this ten year I think it does look as though you know people are calling for her exit by the end of twenty eighteen you know before she ends her turn at the end of eighteen twenty eighteen and it's it looks as though you know she was calling in Lula as to bolster her regime and then ironically calling this scandal with the the you know the the release tapes leaks tapes revealing a conversation with her between her and Lula she's calling that an engineered cool from the elites of the country which I think may illustrate how tone deaf things have become another story we've been following this week is the union between the London Stock Exchange and sociable switches on the cards an agreement is billed as a merger resumes but dirigibles will hold the power in this relationship going to marry yes and they also are more profitable so it's it's interesting to see that the London Stock Exchange is kind of a little bit you know they're they're very much emphasizing that this is a merger of equals that there is sort of a a slight subordination here where to your point you know that the leadership will be very much from Deutsche Borse and the London Stock Exchange it's I think that the shares rallied and and people are feeling much more optimistic for about the deal that they're getting and and it's no stepmother this deal will go ahead with it because there are others sniffing around the London Stock Exchange not least the owners of the New York Stock Exchange absolutely I think you know musical cue here you need to to get that old song sixteen candles up because it is in sixteen years at the London Stock Exchange and those rivers of been doing a little dance around each other since the year two thousand that was the first time a combination of these two was was moved at the fact that it's happening now is interesting in light of the fact that Britain is grappling with the idea of leaving the European Union the people who are promoting this the spokespeople for the two exchanges are saying all the fact that the Briton might leave the European Union that won't affect this at all but there are a lot of things that could affect of that's one of them there's also the matter of the own stock exchanges songs got public shareholders and if Deutsche Boerse is interested and other companies are like the nice the stockholders are going to want to see what other offers they can get the merger is supposed to take place be finalized in a year the first quarter of twenty seventeen there is a lot of running room in between then and now okay well another issue that we've been looking at this week his them all about the value of degrees because Bill Gates Steve Jobs and mark Zuckerberg all a college dropout so is it worth getting a graduate business degree what do you think Mary I think in some cases it can be I've certainly had friends whose whose jobs require them almost to go to graduate school in order to advance in their career which I think might be sort of more of a hat tip to the degree inflation we've seen in the U. S. and elsewhere but I think to your point about Steve Jobs Mexico but there it is not necessary I think Mickey Drexel's that at the Milken conference a few years ago that anytime he gets a resume he hopes that it doesn't have business schools on it because there is kind of a risk of group think and and you go to the same classes it's produced this cadre of people who see the world in a similar way and it's not clear to me that that's necessarily a good thing because I am people stand all for most of money detonate on getting these degrees and if it doesn't encourage the entrepreneurial spark is it really adding value to a Korea well there are lots of different ways to make a lot of money than be an entrepreneur on the other hand it is true that this the fact that these degrees are so expensive I mean an undergraduate degree for years from an elite U. S. institution costs a quarter million dollars now that's a lot of money to basically learn how to learn which is what the undergraduate degree is suppose to be about business school at Lisa's pre professional so the cost benefit analysis of that tends to make sense but on the other hand no degree is an end in itself it's a means to an end once you take that have that MBA you have to apply a certain amount of hard work and initiative and then you have to have a certain amount of luck so Zuckerberg in the rest may not have had the degree but they had all the rest and that maybe in the end is the decisive factor if there are employers out there and they're certainly seem to be some who don't care whether you have a degree from a top ten business school then in a sense the system that rewarded that kind of investment in an MBA is if not broken at least antiquated and that's on bank America New York times with Larry Charles from the left one of Britain's national newspapers the independent will no longer be printed from next week it's moving completely online after losing around seven million dollars over the past year local newspapers in some parts of the UK are flourishing one such paper is the scent Ives times and echo in Cornwall the most southern southwesterly region of Britain it still produces its weekly edition on local printing presses the papers been in circulation since eighteen ninety nine I went along to meet the people who put it together dnmt printing really all known as into Tony kava check out the latest program at the City Lights times and co every week around two and a half thousand because that essays is mass production technique is Abbas changed when Tony began at the paper forty years ago when I stop as well as the newspaper we were doing posters for the local cinema we were still using wooden type setting it by hand and pulling the places by hand on the eighteen nineties compress then as now the paper was sold to newsagents across the small Cornish town which for many years has been a draw for artists with steep narrow streets and galleries on almost every corner according to Tony keeping it local is key to success willow has to do with the time in the community it's very independent it has been a very free monkey community and it has its unique position in the aisle and the newspaper is unique in the fact that it stopped him into the arts colony since the very early days also the fun we do specialize in all time the store shelves might Wilkinson helps decide what will make front page news and is a voluntary Coast Guard he can also be part of the story the whole of life so far over the terms fuel probity okay since pastry box price really have you ever come back to the office with many stories from and to say yeah we do come back and assess everything and get something put together gently appears in the newspaper so to find out just how popular it is I've come to with inequalities entertained although I have just how popular is that sin tights times an echo if you don't follow it you miss out on a limb use of really local news that you can't get anywhere else and then you feel the Cornish Peipus it's kind of traditional and sometimes we have to buy it and we have to read it we sort of call it personalized bibles should I say because everything then that and coming back into the newsroom hair and just in front of me underneath for the main desk is this huge array of bound books dating back to nineteen eleven it's the scent eyes times it's takeout nineteen sixteen and find out what was happening officials of the national news London hit with an Iraq that and it is that a vote of the page you've gotta unknown advert if you've got a bullet in your home simple Simon is the soap for you all possibly have to bring in the advertising back in nineteen sixty Colin sangha used to be ad sales executive at the paper he remembers the advertising heyday the eighties and early fall analysis was the Thatcher years and I do remember then that some of those and fly shingles between fifteen eighteen percent in that period people were spending a lot of money on advertising and it was not unusual to have a newspaper anything from Eckstine papers up to about twenty four and five remember doing twenty book page newspapers another paper is half the size and instead survives on other forms of funding editor Tony comeback and the self publishing private publishing signs strangely enough it is developing side of the business so we're not as dependent as a lot of newspapers all that off just like totally dependent on advertising and don't have don't have anything else it also survives on a strong work ethic tennis father bought the paper back in nineteen fifty one and it's still a family a fat this me boy was exiled to the accounts of Monsanto really works in the businesses photojournalism book designer and graphic artist more somebody also works in the business Kim who is sort of some additional sports and the types of as much of that's about fifty percent of the stuff the paper has made it into the online world the printed edition is still very much the focus so what does the future hold on I have absolutely no idea as to the future but there is no crystal ball I mean when I was at school I wasn't expecting to be in the newspaper and I didn't expect it to be surviving I could something a little bit magical going home that was still going and we still find ways of sticking in Barcelona hoping all I and that was Tony convert the very committee is editor of the eyes times now you might like to know that we hope is a support is celebrating its twenty fifth anniversary in the next few weeks would love you to shed any members of what you were doing when the program was first broadcast first of April nineteen ninety one no jokes please from all of us here thanks for listening goodbye ",
