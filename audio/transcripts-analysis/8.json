    "text": "this is world business report from the BBC world service hello I'm Mike Jones the head of the central bank in Bangladesh quits in the wake of one of the biggest bank rates in history to protect the image of the of the bank I resigned voluntarily attitude big event much higher moral ground as Germany moves to abandon nuclear power the country's energy giants sue for damages the utility companies say that the decision to close down you clear has hit the profits hard it's white value of shareholder wealth and that the decision was illegal rise and spectacular full of Nokia we have a special report from the country of its birth no he was huge in Finland by all indicators it was the arm back bono everything here now we have horrendous unemployment situation what will a new global crackdown on the trade in endangered species due to help save the rhino and will be hearing about a new twist in the long running battle for compensation by American football players who believe their sports damage their health it was one of the world's biggest bank jobs last month unknown side to hack is still more than a hundred million dollars of Bangladeshis foreign currency reserves stored in an account at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York now the head of the Bangladesh central bank at your Rahman has resigned after meeting the country's prime minister in an interview with the BBC Mr Rahman said he was taking responsibility for what happened I thought you protected the image of the of the bank you know I yeah resigned voluntarily attitude big Arab right it much higher moral ground not many examples out there in the country you know to really take that responsibility morally and then resigned Olsen told banks and the banks should be very careful about the cyber attack this is you know a terrorist act its belief that cyber thieves used computer malware or malicious software to steal authorization codes and transfer a hundred and one million dollars from the Bangladeshi central banks in New York accounts to Sri Lanka and the Philippines that the theft happened in early February it only came to light last week government officials said they were angry that they hadn't been told earlier it's about us is South Asia bureau chief for the Financial Times newspaper in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka we think it could be one of the biggest bank robberies ever even the great train robbery in the UK in today's money did not reap as much reward for the thieves as this house of and it's it's really a very important warning sign for warning bell for banks around the world whether the central banks of commercial banks and indeed for for large corporations because it shows that money can be transferred from their accounts without the knowledge now it's true that we don't know yet whether there was some insider on the bank that help the process but is no evidence of that yet and it's possible that this was an entirely external attack are using software using malware and that there was no inside operator helping to authenticate the codes for the money transfers but obviously this money was deposited at the U. S. central bank the U. S. federal reserve I note the time the question marks I would who is happy to blame for lax security you might think that the finger of blame would point at the Americans rather than the Bangladeshis that's right now the Bangladeshis did initially say that they thought the fed was partly to blame for not insuring that was full authentication of these transfers the fed has responded voted systems were not in any way compromised and it simply followed normal procedure using the swift electronic transfer system and that therefore it's it's it's nothing to do with them though I don't think it's any doubt that the money was transferred from the Bangladesh count in New York at the federal reserve and how much do we know now about how this attack actually happened and and where on earth the money has gone too well how the heck happened with still not sure about it seems to have been a piece of a malicious software that possibly clone the authentication codes and that for our need the transfers but the the place where most of them went the ones that got through was the Philippines and and they were apparently for accounts with a result commercial banking corporation in Manila and then the money somehow find its way some of it to to casino groups and thirty million dollars seems to being handed over in cash to a man in Manila this is according to the Philippines anti money laundering council and was in fact a hearing today of the Philippine Senate about this whole issue because obviously the Philippines is now under a lot of pressure to tighten up its money laundering legislation or rather it's actually money laundering implementation of of those those that was victim us if the Financial Times in Dacca now the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster in Japan five years ago sent shockwaves around the world in the aftermath countries rush to review their nuclear programs you didn't shoot divisiveness and step by step we will abandon nuclear energy by the end of twenty twenty two spouse is a big challenge for Germany but it also means huge opportunities for future generations we believe that our country can become a frontrunner for the creation of renewable energy gone in again via concurrence the German government led by Anglo mackel made a landmark decision in the aftermath of Fukushima to close down all its nuclear power plants it was a decision though which angered the big four utility companies in Germany which include element RWE they are now suing the government for damages worth almost twenty eight billion dollars jammies constitutional courts the country's highest has begun a two day hearing on the case the BBC's Damian McGinnis in Berlin told me more the utility companies say that they have plans and vested according to this earlier agreements and that the decision to close down you clear has hit their profits hard it's white value of shareholder wealth in the utility companies say it's really a clear case of property rights and the rule of law are effectively and that the decision was illegal government on the other hand says that this was a legal decision and that it not only met all the legal requirements but the environment minister has said earlier today in court that it was the right decision said the government feels it has the moral high ground and argues that the shutdown was necessary after Fukushima because the risks have changed so much in Japan as a result of the meltdown that this was necessary to do in Germany to stop any risk of something similar happening happening here okay so these companies are not trying to reverse the government's decision to shut down all nuclear power plants by twenty twenty two they're simply trying to claim some money for the losses they say they would incur as a result yes absolutely Mike and I think that's an important clarification you're quite right it's not about continuing nuclear power and certainly after the sudden decision in two thousand and eleven by the government there's there's no chance that any company in Germany would not once we've been investing you clear because even if they were able to after twenty twenty two it's very unlikely that any utility company would have enough faith to invest in you clear what it really is about is getting money for this sudden decision which they feel really took away their property rights and is against the rule of law and you mentioned that it was a popular decision the government's decision to change course on nuclear is that still the case does the public the general public still back the government in in a case like this do you think that yes I think it's fair to say that nuclear power here was always controversial and now since Fukushima it's also been very unpopular Anglo MacColl's decision was extremely popular issues even accuse of being quite populist in taking this decision because she was really following the public support public opinion and I also has to be said the big utility companies there are not that popular there often accused of hiking prices and not passing on low fuel costs to customers so I think we can safely say the government probably has the popular opinion on his side but the question here is whether it was legal because we're talking here about the highest courts in Germany the Constitutional Court and so they wouldn't be looking a popular opinion they will be looking at so what happens next two day hearing then what's that mean yeah that's rice is the Tuesday hearing we're going to have both sides over the next few days and the decision is expected to take a couple of months at least both sides say they are confident of winning the case I am the utility firm says a clear cut case of property rights of rule of law the government says this was a legal decision am but I think this really has ramifications they because what is not only about the tens of billions of dollars that this could cost the government if the government lost it's also about further compensation as a result of this shutdown a nuclear powered by twenty twenty cities if if the government loses this this could just be the start of a whole range of other lawsuits I was timing McGinnis in Berlin you listen to world business report from the BBC world service still to come on the program just how dangerous is American footbal we do need to have an ethical discussion about at what age did you start exposing a child to the possibility of this disease that will rock their brain for the rest of their life so let's catch up with the latest from the financial markets Jasper Lola from CMC markets joins me live Jasper a Canadian pharmaceuticals companies making the headlines what's the company and wise in the spotlight good evening my guess is valiant pharmaceuticals and so investors have really been taken to the cleaners on this one this stock is actually down forty seven percent just today as as far back as August was trading at two hundred sixty dollars now trading at forty dollars on the justification for today is that it's it's a revised pounds in its earnings estimates of it Mr estimates in its previous quarter but the greatest story here is that Sir the company's facing some serious problems Hillary Clinton of all people actually specifically reference the company saying she would go after them in one of her campaign ads this because he described what they've been doing is predatory pricing so basically they're a pharmaceutical company they sell drugs what they've been doing is taking advantage of that position and selling these drugs are really elevated prices something that most people can't afford and it's really bring up costs across the whole US healthcare system it's a real hot political issue at the moment but not only that they've actually been been investigated by the SEC which is the regulator over in the U. S. for doing some sort of accounting trickery with one of their distributors inflating sales are a lot of problems with the company it is being reflected in the surprise I unless they in the United States retail sales are in the spotlight to face today that was the big data points today absolutely obviously with wit taking every data point in mind head of the federal reserve meeting tomorrow where they could raise interest rates and the retail sales declined point one percent in February inside that was actually in line with expectations did the bigger issue is that actually the numbers for January I got revised much lower than was previously expected inside the big worry here is the violent US consumers going out and spending with this cuts from gasoline prices that we should all be benefiting from its its just raising a little bit of concern as to where that strength is from the US consumer when the economy appears to be growing attack just thank you for not shooting fast just below a joining us live from CMC markets in the city of London with the main share index here in London finished the day down no point six percent six thousand one hundred forty the Dow was so low on Wall Street is down about a fifth of a percent seventeen thousand two hundred currencies viewers at one dollar eleven point one U. S. sense the pounds trading at one dollar forty one point six now if I asked you to name a famous company from Finland I'll bet that Nokia would be the name that most readily springs to mind is probably the only name I just ten years ago Nokia was the world's biggest name in mobile phones helping Finland punch way above its weight on the global economic stage with the rise of smartphones the company struggled two years ago Nokia abandoned the phone market completely Edwin lane has been to Finland's to find out where it went wrong for Nokia and what impact it's demise has had on the economy I'm walking through the snow in the center of a small finish town that's looks at first glance typical of many others around this part of the world pays some squat grey blocks of flats huddled in the snow and as a strip of shops supermarkets couple of restaurants but this is a place with a very famous name Nokia it's about two hours north of the Finnish capital Helsinki and this is the town that gave its name to Finland's most sick cesspool international brand Nokia mobile phones a company that revolutionized the mobile phone industry and help propel Finland's economy some come one of the most prosperous in the world dnmt for me personally I think a one of the high points was when we actually have to Frank the mobile phones small of a multilateral and that was around nineteen ninety seven nineteen ninety eight serves the people at the heart of the Nokia story with Sepahan tia Anita grinned stram both senior managers that not his main mobile phone research and development sites in Tampa just down the road from Nokia back then the brief was simple make the phone with the best battery life the biggest screen but make it smaller than anyone else cooler able to and I'll try to learn and make mistakes and learn as a team people knew that that there were kind special skills that damn are appreciated and music continues when things started to go wrong for Nokia were you aware of that happening well I was in that one meeting there it was that you did that day and demonstrate the iPhone before day lost at this was an advert for the for the iPhone the sort you cheap in a in a in a quite a high level meeting in Nokia this hundred and fifty people managers really yes you can do that in NBC but are they able to do that infonet and can they do that really every once in awhile a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything is a revolutionary dnmt when Steve Jobs unveiled apples only phone in two thousand and seven the smartphone market so cough a Nokia struggle to keep up just seven years later gnocchi would be taken over by Microsoft and Nokia phones would disappear altogether Benwood is a mobile phone industry analyst at CCS insights it happened much faster than anyone had predicted and it was because they were completely wrong footed by the new technology apple arrived apps arrived funds became computers in your hand the internet was exploding people wanted the internet in that pocket knock you miss that unda paid a very heavy price so for about fifteen minutes down the road from the town of Nokia its of the biggest city in the straw Finland it's Tampa it's the old industrial heartland unsteady in the central square just outside the town hall and around me at this smoke stacks of old red brick warehouses and factories that tell the story of the industrial past of the city but more recently it's been Nokia that has dominated this local economy this one is to be one of our an old paper mill then there's an old factory signed off on the right here car you can color is director of economic and urban development for the city of tempera when not his main research and development sites once employed four thousand hightech skilled workers around three quarters of those jobs are now gone along with thousands of handset manufacturing jobs in other parts of the country no he was huge in Finland by all indicators for example of the are Andy spending so the nation ninety Nokia's peak one third came from public sector one third came third came yeah and that's national it was the backbone old everything here the university's relied on our extensive collaboration with Nokia the kids were relying on being employed by Nokia now we have horrendous unemployment situation currently for Finland the malaise of Nokia could not have come at a worse time since the financial crisis the economy's struggle to emerge from session not his failure is emblematic of a wider economic malaise but for a new generation to finish tech entrepreneurs it represents such unity I had a son Thomas cook them on the site late for that Celinda pickup in Helsinki humus spent most of his career working for Nokia as a software engineer spending several years in California's Silicon Valley now he's returned home to help cultivates Finland's post Nokia tech startup scene he shows me around his new offices for I know where an imprint of whatever it's one of the older district so one of the trendier once nowadays space were in right now it's an old factory it's feels like a very tech startup environment is a table full table and Mike is a swing everyday what what happens in the swing we actually had to have two functional swings they're just decorate some some make it look like very trendy Fatima's Nokia's legacy is a wealth of talent and expertise waiting to be tapped the talent hasn't really gone anywhere the share magnitude of Nokia in Finland means that there's a pool of big talent but how has experience in the field have deep specialized knowledge in certain areas that you you not gain by going through an educational some but Finland thing was buzzing with with high tech you know skills and I'm I'm startups before I look around I see a lot of smaller companies that are trying to make a big impact on the mark holding owns those skills and learning the lessons of Nokia's failures may be key to determining whether Finland will again lead the world in technology but back in the snow of temper former Nokia manages secco ha Thea and Micah green stream say that a company of Nokia's dominance and size is unlikely to be seen again does he doesn't he said saying sing so that they know racers are maybe not coming through the big companies it sass more companies start up companies summation of course business and likes to have something that they can say one thing one one sportsman no one company or whatever but now maybe I will move to a phase of people like that they're all different kind of stories and it's more diverse that report that from the BBC's Edwin lane in Finland we have a dedicated to save the rhino if we're lucky that was the message from prince William that you came which today as he unveiled an agreement to crack down on illegal wildlife trade routes worldwide he said the rhino could even be extinct within five years unless more was done to protect it the next five to ten years of personals a massive change a dramatic change in the way really appreciates and protects these iconic species in Africa that would be these incredible animals that which not only is obviously side for future generations but I think it would be incredibly devastating for humanity itself when we I've sat back and we've lost something that we've been responsible for if we haven't achieved something with the next five ten years then we will be almost impossible to do anything else laughs because the numbers will be surgically saves the damage will be done so badly and clearly the Dimond way to be hoaxes the agreement is being called the Buckingham Palace declaration after where was signed leaders of global airlines shipping firms port operators and customs agencies have agreed to do more to prevent the illegal trade in endangered species I'm Cali see Sibanda ease regional officer for East Africa the worldwide fund for nature how helpful did he think the new agreement was the Buckingham Palace said declaration is that represents a step change in our fight against illegal wildlife trade around the world and we are saying through it that it's going to become a high risk business at being involved in this kind of criminality but presumably wildlife traffic is a clever when it comes to hiding that tracks what more can the companies said that are involved in this declaration that transport companies airlines ports operators what more can they do to try to expose what's going on realistically do you think through this declaration with saying that let's let's come together caught in a tie efforts in giving information in making sure that the next part has the information that they require that they have people who are able to to to identify those products and making sure that we catch the criminals that actually putting his products in the airlines and getting them through our parts and you know planes and I sheeps how much progress then are we making into as a getting on top of this problem in terms of making endangered species less and then did the rhino for example prince William says what we could have just five years before the run it becomes extinct are we making progress we making incredible progress and we working in the countries where there is a product of being sold in between the sauce and where it's being sold we are now cutting that link and saying the transporters and artists and the public are working together to say that he's not as zero tolerance for any tread in between those places and that that will go a long way in ensuring that we have zero poaching in the future what about the issue of demand to though that the still a lot of demand for example for rhino horn from an increasingly affluent Asian middle class and like China and Vietnam rhino horns prize for medicines I think that it is a little search of work to be done on the demand side we certainly have been working with the wrench states with the demand countries to educate the the population about the fact that actually are for example the rhinos where people think that it it meant it has medicinal purposes that that is not so we working hard with that those countries to make sure that anyone that that is selling the rhino horns ivory is caught and sentenced appropriately so we reckon with the costs we reckon with the wildlife fat authorities that we increasing security and dealt with a but authorities as well I was thinking that you actually see Sibanda at the worldwide fund for nature it's the richest sports in the world and the most popular in the United States but just how dangerous is American football that's been heated debates about the long term impact of head injuries thousands of former National Football League or NFL players have sued for damages a federal judge has approved a one billion dollar compensation package currently on hold pending the outcome of an appeal now in what some believe could be a watershed moment atop NFL executive said there is a link between the sports and it degenerative brain disease health and safety officer Jeff Miller acknowledge before Congress that there is a connection between football related brain trauma and a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE E. Chris Nowinski co founder of a Boston charity called the concussion legacy foundation gave me his reaction I'm very happy to hear the NFL finally admit that they believe there is a link between playing football and developing chronic dramatic encephalopathies for the last ten years since the first discovery of this disease the football player was made they've actually denied that they thought football was the cause of this what you think significance will be in terms of the legal action that we've seen from former players it's hard to say I've been reading that some lawyers think that they won't change anything other one hold out hope that this admission I'll change the course of the settlement because what's interesting about the settlement between former NFL players in the NFL is that the settlement does not cover a diagnosis of chronic somatic encephalopathies the only disease that we really think is linked to playing football the other diseases covers that link has yet to be established as strongly as he interesting because we haven't seen the debate here in the UK about sa rugby noticeable this massive in the U. S. but whether schools should really be allowed to go in for full on tackling in rugby so there is a real debate isn't there across all sorts of sports around the world about trying to make them safer there is and there should be mean we we have established in this disease was first established in boxers and everyone sort of course boxers get see either punch drunk in each other and head and this is what happens and now we finally opened up our eyes to the fact that getting punched in the head is not any different than guitar playing football and colliding with your head or having a soccer ball or tackling and rugby in having your head fall off someone's knee snow in skip the concussion legacy foundation in ofertas nickel will be back with business matters an hour of business news and comment at one o'clock GMT here on the world service thanks listing their to this world business report there are many ways to keep up with the BBC world service join us on social media all sign of a pub costs and BBC world service dot com slash part because ",
