    "text": "this is world business report from the BBC world service on Mike Johnson Europe central bank reveals a surprise package of measures designed to breathe new life into the fracking eurozone economy but will it work monetary policy can momentarily take you out of trouble but it cannot be in the long run the basis of a sustainable growth we need structural reform also in the program a new parliament but no governments as voters tide of austerity punish the political elites in Ireland stop trump the Republican campaign to derail the property billionaires tilt for the White House the establishment Republicans are both bold and toothless they've pulled out their hair in the gnashing their teeth and as part of the BBC's annual school report today will be hearing how a milk price crisis is forcing some British farmers out of business it's very difficult at the moment especially with people around you exiting at the rate they are extinct because there is no bright future at the moment that's all coming up over the next half an hour sign low or no growth weak consumer spending prices in the shops for me it's no economic policy right now for the nineteen countries which make up the your sign one of the European central bank has announced a new raft of measures to try to turn things around is being seen by investors a surprisingly aggressive with me in the studio to explain what is Ross mode at the investment company Asia pale how high the Russert just explain simply what is the bank will first of all it's cooked three different interest rates one of which it took deeper into negative territory some banks could have to pay more to park their cash for the European central bank increase the scope of its money printing or quantity feeding program by a third and also it's taken money printing problems it's not just a bike government bonds but also culprit bones as well to try and drive down the cost of borrowing for companies and this was seen as a pretty surprisingly dramatic move me to drive you talked about doing something for three months of people smell something coming but definitely a lot more nobody saw the increase to the constant easing program by a third and nobody saw the ball the culprit bombs coming either what she sees designed to do what he supposed at least to be the impacts on real households real business and I think in the end what is trying to do is get banks to lend more money and make more credit available to borrowers to households to companies to try and stimulate European economic growth the problem is that over the last twelve months without a loss of kiwi already and the results frankly a very very mixed inflation is no different from what was a year ago GDP growth is a little bit higher manufacturing sentiment surveys a little bit lower so it's it's there's no proof that it's the correct solution thank you for now I will be back to you later in the program to hear a little bit more about the reception investors cave to central bank announced first of all let's get some reaction from two euro zone economies Spain and Germany Spain first wet kasha bank has more customers than any other Judy go why is chief economist and what did he think of what Europe central bank at them the monetary policy that the central bank in Europe we set undertaking was justified in the beginning given the crisis year but as time goes by quantitative easing and then negative interest rates becomes already ineffective and in fact can have dangerous it makes the business models all of and he should not sustainable ugly mauled by it hurts savers it is unclear that it will promote far there are spending because people sometimes half saving targets and you are not paid for your savings you decide to you and say more the X. penalizing the creditors I guess is also hurting real profits as well these hard to top line was net interest income but of course bunks which are a very diversified provides a lot of study says he should and investment funds have other sources of revenue but the trouble is set a Florida small and medium sized firms surely though the European central bank has to do something it's trying to oil the wheels of what is a very sluggish economy in the eurozone it's trying to Stoke a little bit of inflation by trying to encourage banks like yours not to just park their money with the central bank but landed out into the real economy instead when you are at a drug bottom interest rates went up project a new investment projects undertaken or not doesn't depend on a few basis points so you have to convince investors that you will have sufficiently stable tax regime sufficiently stable regulatory regimes otherwise monetary policy is not the only instrument the banks also extended its stimulus package today your reaction to that is not something you would applaud expectations were high so they had to uglies satisfy part of the espy the market and to extend the package I think it was an appropriate moves in the debate wiring that almost whatever the central bank in Europe does doesn't seem to really be having much effect the goals of the real economy at the end of today is the result of increased productivity and that comes from the supply side from document so monetary policy can momentarily take you out of trouble but it cannot be in the long run the basis of a sustainable growth we need structural reforms that was the chief economist at the Spanish bank kaisha Jordy cool to Germany now with the economy's faring sunny better than spying there are some signs that consumers are getting nervous about spending money also fisheries chief executive of the Berlin stock exchange and he's been giving me his reaction to today's news really have people consuming more than they used in the past they are less worried to spend money that was surprising over the last year that tests slow down a little bit not a lot the reason for that is a bit unclear what certainly helps consumption is as a refugee crisis something like one point two million refugees in in Germany and via creating a lot of infrastructure for them so that also boosts consumption to some extent some people think that's authorities ought to be doing what what has been called people's quantitative easing in other words putting measures in place that time just for example benefit banks but their benefit Sir household is a and that might mean just simply I did I writing people out checks for a certain amount of money and and encouraging them to go out and spend it with that work very dangerous very dangerous one of the side effects of both the central bank is doing is if you might get into a housing bubble in Germany because money so cheap said now people are starting to apply houses because they don't want to spend the money on consumption see one invested seconde really do it conservatively in the bank's sit on one of my expertise that's a little bit too risky for them so they're going to buying houses and rent them out and there is a public building up because as soon as interest rates will go up send our people can't afford to to to pay interest so that's that's a problem giving people money in their hands without increasing production is is a very dangerous game to play I wouldn't I wouldn't do that and what was not dangerous to to give banks all the money that we've given them good question actually and that was a different a topic we didn't give them money to bank so they could spend it on themselves for on on salaries on because we gave banks money so we and Hans a balance sheet so they wouldn't go bust that's a different thing we always tried to stop getting those kind of monies into the and a cash flow of the economy we always tried not to do that would be it but central bank is doing at the moment is central bank tries to encourage banks not just to park their money at the bank itself say one of the banks to loan the money but the banks are reluctant to loan money because have worried about the risks they take on board and this is what the central bank is fighting now what happened in Germany which I find rather interesting we have actually last year and and even this year tendencies that salaries increase speed historically have a very slow increase in salaries and that has changed to some extent that's doing what you've Australia increase of salaries will give people more money in the pocket and suspended that is happening but it's not happening because the government is saying it is happening because everybody can see that Germany's doing well and or the workers want to participate in that grows the chief executive of the Berlin stock exchange arts who officia right now has promised to a regular market commentator rust note it's HA bell who still with me in the street addresses we first said this was something of a surprise to investors how did they react the sneeze from the central bank while the financial markets initially gave Mr Dracula response that you want to check prices went up bond yields went down and the euro went down but all of that completely reversed in the last two was a I was of trading public is Mr Draghi because he's own growth and inflation forecasts if you say we're trying more something hasn't really works over the past year and all students at at the end that may be for interest rate cuts are may not do anymore ways after previous ECB meetings he said he's always dangle the carrot of I will do whatever it takes to get the growth to get growth going so I think that since he took everybody but even further by surprise and as a result share prices she ended the day down bond yields unchanged and your ashy end of the day strong with how it started which isn't what Mister John you want to say it's all he'll want Europe to go down to try and give European exporters of competitive boost and drive growth without mechanisms are things aren't working but not of my findings bazooka no fee and if you look over the last year since kiwi was introduced the European stoxx six hundred index is stock index is down chairman bond yields are key proteome changed and he always stronger against the dollar so it doesn't seem to be having the desired effect in the financial markets and in the real world druggies because he's on inflation GDP focus again Sir again its case very very much improvement that throwing money at the problem quite literally is the solution okay and also going to talk about island in just a moment in the program but there was some eye catching news about the health of the Irish economy fourth quarter GDP growth number of nine point two percent of for a full year twenty fifteen that was ninety eight percent I accept the best there is quite low but if you looking for a case study of a country that went through a brutal austerity program and is now coming out of the other side island is it I accept that there's been emigration that rather like Latvia that was another post a child for the high school of economics the Austrian school of economics taking medicine go through this process of structural reform and you will eventually begin to get rewards and island another pop the voters aren't very happy about it but the economic numbers are starting to come through I can just like you very much indeed that was Ross mould from and here's a bell let's put some numbers on those market changes are now than the Mensheviks here in London ended the day down almost two percent at six thousand and thirty seven the Dow in New York is also low at the moment it's down no point seven percent economy stands at sixteen thousand eight hundred and eighty two on the currency markets the euro is at one dollar eleven point nine your sense that's a rise for the euro of one and a half year census that Ross was saying that and just learning about that with the pounds at one dollar forty three point one that's a rise for sterling of not point seven sensibilities slit for the oil price Cypriot light crude that Saddam seventy five cents at thirty seven point five seven dollars a barrel well in a few weeks time island is marking the centenary of the Easter Rising rebellion against British rule recently that Irish voters staged a rebellion of their own at the ballot box anger about the impact of austerity and the introduction of water charges leads to an inconclusive general election results two weeks ago the outgoing government of enda Kenny's Finnigan and its coalition labor party lost an election in which no one won an overall majority islands new parliament met for the first time today but still no sign of a new government Dimmitt Fleming reports mt dnmt understanding and more street right in the center of Dublin on beside me are the buildings for the leaders of the nineteen surrendered on lost a hundred years ago they were trying to form a government for Ireland footwear under rather more pressure them today's politicians we're trying to do the same dnmt I leann street is famed for its street markets we are stoles with an array of vegetables and fruits from all over the country and around the world it's a place where people come to strike a bargain instead of going to the supermarket so the women and men who work here know better than most as to how to strike a deal entree into nd yeah I want to you're the heart and the business here and more street doesn't bother you that there's nobody up wheelhouse of the economy I think it's actually people that's torn and economy diplomatic that store and economy also much the government and it's it's hard working people declared itself what we were in the first place do you think it makes a difference Husin government not definitely not considered a sign to bring and so now it's harness walk to charges you name it they have certain of the safe artists from my personal front they don't give a damn you know what I mean dnmt three yeah and no problem anything else sweet talk for the customers but not for the last governments the anger here not matching the praise it one internationally for steering Arlin from bailouts to the fastest growing economy in the U. her remarkable turnaround for the deeply unpopular austerity policies driving has cost the government power Chris Mooney says life is tough on the minimum wage here ends of nine euro fifteen or just over ten dollars an hour and a struggle to pay soaring rents with the housing crisis following a construction crash most people I've spoken to have very negative attitudes towards their recent governments that we Huff and power and I I just hope that it would just going to be more on the people side on the contest content better solutions on agreements to make art and a better place to live nnat water charges brought in by the last government had to mass protests Paul Murphy member of the artists parliament for the anti austerity alliance is facing charges over one demonstration I think the water protest did two things I think one they brought home to people the real nature of the recovery which is a recovery for the rich and a continuation of a robbery of the rest on a transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top and secondly they gave an edge to the anger about that because they showed things could be different people work mobilizing on the streets were protesting and were boycotting refusing to pay for the water charges nnat no charges remain at center stage in talks over a new government syndicated stands by the book rivals fina fol say their scrap the new company artist water and suspend charges for five years forty percent of people have not pay their bills with the uncertainty meaning this figure may grow according to a survey this week dnmt listeners in central Dublin plaster my way with which way is the question everyone is asking for how our internet twenty two I can do that was deemed it Fleming reporting from now who can stop Donald Trump the billionaire property magnate's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination continues to gather momentum when it comes to his opponents the gloves are certainly coming off dnmt shop University we teach success former students say trump university was a scam costing up to thirty five thousand dollars for an unlicensed illegal school that offered no actual degrees a federal court ruled that trumps company hired illegal immigrants to help the construction process for trump tower even paid million dollar fine and his new hotel in Washington The Washington Post interviewed about fifteen laborers and the DC hotel site reporting that many revealed they had entered the U. S. illegally Republican opponents of Donald Trump of been spending big money on ads attacking him ones you just have a funded by a group called al principles political action committee supporters of Republican rival Marco Rubio now funding more anti trump hence ahead of a must win primary Mr reviews home state of Florida on Tuesday when we talk about what Sesame been an eye catching presidential the nomination campaign so far with a regular commentator Irving stone's are at the Hudson institute in Washington and I started by asking just how worried sections of the Republican Party were about the prospect of a trump victory the establishment Republicans are both bold and toothless they've pulled out their hair in the gnashing their teeth because they have a real dilemma they don't believe trump can beat Hillary Clinton and anyhow they find him an embarrassment on the other hand if they deny him the nomination at the convention if he goes in with a plurality of delegates the try army will March out of the party and they will lose the election do you think the Republicans who do feel Donald Trump would be unelectable and that's mainly because at those celebrated plans to build a wall along the Mexican border impose a temporary ban on old Muslims entering the us is that true do you think Donald Trump would be unelectable I don't think he's unelectable for two reasons first of all the polls don't show him that much behind Hillary Clinton and second of all she's a very weak candidate she just can't seem to connect with the voters she lost to socialist Bernie Sanders in Michigan she's having a lot of trouble getting voters in the Midwest she's got an army of unmarried women who represent twenty five percent of the eligible electorate they're overwhelmingly for Mrs Clinton and African Americans who if they vote which is not at all clear because a president Obama's not at the head of the ticket give her a big edge on the other hand Mr trump has brought millions of people who have never voted before into the voting process so I don't think it's certain that trump would lose to of Mrs Clinton but I think what is certain is that the Republican Party as we have understood it free trade polite feet wasabi party will never be the same if trump is the nominee rights because he's got some pretty transient views on on China as well he's proposed new tariffs on imports from China that's very much anti free trade how appealing it a message is that you seem to American voters well protectionism is the idea of the day in both parties the days of my America being enormously for free trade at least its political class is over trump says he's a free trader he just wants to negotiate better than the morons on our side who have been negotiating deals Mrs Clinton is against the trans Pacific trade deal the mass of the Democratic Party in the Congress is against it we are now I protectionist country for all intents and purposes we have to point out the Donald Trump seems to be striking a slightly more conciliatory notes in recent days dozens he I guess he could just of course be the decent like his radical in office if you ever get sent far as he has been on the campaign trail it would be the first time for politicians remember he doesn have deep ideological convictions so it's easier for him to to change his position and in fact he's given a sort of long talk defending changing your position and you know that's in the great tradition of John Maynard Keynes when the facts change I change my positions what do you do Sir so that's in it but but basically it's a fact of life in America that the founding fathers were brilliant and constrain the ability of the president to do exactly as he pleases when he pleases were not a parliamentary system the president can't announce a budget like your chancellor for example can announce a budget he can't make trade deals are not make trade hills the thoughts that of the US economist Irwin styles are at the Hudson institute in Washington just remind you listen to the BBC world service the world's radio station and it's a very special good evening if you happen to be listening to us on digital short wave old DRM in India on five point eight four five Meg now it Sir PPC school reports today that stain the effort in when we throw open our doors to eleven to sixteen year olds and given the chance to create their own news reports about subjects important to them here in the UK dairy farming is **** a crossroads increase supply and sluggish demand on presenting some big challenges no prices have fallen and many dairy farms are going out of business soap for this year's school reports we can hear from a group of young people from a village that has given its name to one of the world's most famous cheeses Chad in southwest England his their reports on how the milk price crisis is affecting young people's price and in March twenty fifteen we the kings and queens news team investigates the falling prices paid farmers for them out over the last twelve months however things have gone from bad to worse with the average price police page dropping from twenty three point seven one pence litre to fifteen pence litre over the last year which led to many farmers selling up and leaving the industry into right complaints about because in them so they can only see another account respect local dairy farm and actress Jane thought has played a big part in the campaign for a fair price in the performance over the past few years how do you see or a dairy farm in the next ten years to thing is going to grow is again a good small display completely I'm twenty nine years old I'm so third generation working on this from whistle tenth generation in this area farming personnel like to see a very prosperous and vibrant future for this farm you know entitled to produce milk just because your family is pretty smoke you need to make sure that you are producing milk so that a business can operate we are not we are farmers that's a hundred percent correct but we also have to be businessmen and making sure that we make the correct business decisions that is sustainable for our own businesses and our own futures to make sure that we can stay in the industry and continue to produce a product they said would be left that stressful I think it certainly because of the moment of stress yeah home life subsidy affected by everything that happens here I did tell my wife that when she realized she was marrying me that she was marrying the cows as well that obviously they do come first to which we are managing and we are coping it's very difficult at the moment especially with people around you exiting at the rate they are extinct because there is no bright future at the moment thumbing the lifestyle as well as an occupation respect for young students at the academy regarding how fully milk prices have affect their life path and what the future holds I'm Joe day and my family's been farming for about three generations well struggles or difficulties of the risen Jesus the price of milk that are many difficulties due to the price of milk but it's not just the dairy farmers I mean my family's beef and sheep farmers and my brother's a agricultural constructor say affects him as well like outside of farming because I mean if you run out of life dairy animals and things he can't go off and build a shed say it's all about everyone else's wellness like dairy farmers do you have any worries about the future I just hope that people come to their senses and pay more for milk for his it's pretty ridiculous at the moment I mean got to Tesco's buy bottled water for eighty six pay by two pints of milk for seventy five PS asi ridiculous I midday and my family's been farming for over eight generations well struggles or difficulties the risen Jesus the price of milk shortages in money bike for extra fame say a **** truck breaks down
