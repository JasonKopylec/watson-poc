    "text": "this is world business report from the BBC world service I'm Mike Johnson more austerity lower growth forecasts and a surprise new tax on sugary drinks Britain's finance minister George Osborne delivers his latest budget piece separately trying to I think become more popular trying to win a few votes and pretend that if the economy does well it's down to have medical since does badly then it's down to the interest also in the program a new global share trading superpower is born has the main stock exchanges in Britain and Germany agreed to merge what they're trying to do is accept and endorse the fact that Marcus by doing a deal it was a total **** you have to have striven commercially a new twist in Nigeria's ongoing battle against corruption eight year old children on the government payroll as teachers and we got wandering under clear south American skies to hear about Chiles ambition to be a world leader install gazing back and from Santiago to try to see the stars supposedly did the thing who are we in this planet still come after the next often outside a dangerous cocktail of risks buddies how Britain's finance minister George Osborne has described the global economy delivering his latest budgets he announced lower growth forecasts blaming a global slowdown and weaker productivity at home Mister Osborne admitted he will fail to hit his target bring down government debt as a proportion of the economy this year but he predicted the public finances would be back to surplus by twenty twenty the year coincidently perhaps of the next general election to try to cheat that's they'll be almost five billion dollars of new cuts to public spending this was Mr Osborne delivering the budget to parliament we set our country would not repeat the mistakes of the past and instead to live within our means today we maintain that commitment to long term stability in challenging times decisive action to achieve a ten billion we are so we don't pay later we put the next generation plus he revealed that Britain will become the latest country to tax sugary soft drinks to help tackle childhood obesity the money raced around seven hundred million dollars a year will be spent funding sports in schools the budget also gave the green light to new rail link between the northern English city of Manchester and Leeds no Sir another new rail line crossing London but John what all he speaks on finance for the opposition labor party wasn't impressed budget based on fire economic growth down business investment down trade him down wages slowing down and he's missed targets all over again rezone fiscal rule he's he's missed on debt is missed on deficit as well because remember he was suppose to what the deficit launched you and this idea he's going to make a surplus it looks as though he's been using creative accountancy to actually make that surface the main tax on British companies is to full more sharply than previously announced to seventeen percent within four years basis while Griffith has been getting reaction from one manufacturer in South Wales yes I'm here in a small factory in but reports west Wales glorious sunshine outside right on the coast but here in the fabrications workshop I'm joined by the managing director of I'm Connie Owen Davis family firm been here forty years ago about thirty employees this is meant to be a budget for small business to do it for you yes I think it did twist I we had a bit more than I was expecting if I'm being honest and all in all a fairly positive budget we see this team here working around you make sound proofing unconscious so I guess your customers right across the board has business been recent yes our products get shipped all over the world they get used in mining quarrying and all sorts of industrial applications I think that it's fair to say that last year was an orphanage here but this say here it is there at forecasting to global bet wed to an okay I think it's fair to say so what was in the budget that might help you next year a reduction in cooperation talks is a big thing going from twenty seventy percent which is nice to have obvious if you will have the staying as it is because we got vehicles equipment down the motorways whether something she would have liked to have heard today from George Osborne that would think yes I think I was hoping to get more support for apprentices for example review to the apprentice live in the past doesn't affect us because we don't imply two hundred fifty people backed up some of the levees are they putting on a large corporations they could have shed down to the SME sector and given us additional support and another thing I was disappointed not to seeing no support for the title of Gordon a new industry for windows which would be the world's first indeed I think an opportunity lost to be able to support that sector for us as a manufacturer to be huge opportunities to develop new technology in that part of the world that's canoes natural resources to generate power so for you is a pretty small company in this rural part of west Wales but trying to export globally one of the big challenges ahead our confidence I think is a big challenge getting enough confidence if week if this continual talk of depression and lack of growth that would be a big challenge we're trying to come to knock that but what the chancellor has done in previous budget is given us confidence to invest with cement investment relief in the past and obviously with what he's done today's given us some support so cash flow will ease over the next year so I wind Davis managing director of and Connie speaking to her well Griffith in South Wales the British budget also move to lower taxes paid by smaller companies on their business premises known as rates might cherry is policy director at the federation of small businesses he believes that his members will be pleased with what I heard we very much welcome some of the detailed announcements around some of the tax the small businesses have been suffering from one of the biggest things FSB was saying when we have the election last year was first and foremost businesses needed to have proper long term consistent supporter secondly they needed to see the cost of doing business actually being reduced by government and I think when you take all of that into account while the chancellor has clearly done is to listen and to understand what those concerns are if you happen to be a company that makes sugary drinks or are involved with the selling of sugary drinks he may be less less please what about this mayor to impose attacks on those kinds of drinks South Africa Nelson excimer a couple weeks back Mexico's already done it I'm certainly not pretending to be in that sector or indeed have any knowledge of the silence around but I think listening to what chancellor has said it is not going to come in until twenty eighteen nights a couple years time it clearly I he said hopes to be able to give businesses the chance to modify what ever ingredients they do put into those drinks from what I everybody's saying the health issues around this is not helping our young people and I think coming on so that some of the announcements that we're now seeing around supporting young people listening to what businesses need around education and skills are welcome steps on the long journey that we need to be making to give consistent good education a good training and good apprenticeship to our young people is absolutely critical for the UK in the future Georgios from the finance minister underlined again today that growth in British productivity is weak why is that do you think is not a problem with the global economy or is that a problem with the British economy if you look at the statistics they say that the Japanese economy is far less productive than not the global economy in particular are European competitors and particularly in relation to North America for instance when you are small businesses about their productivity they would ritual that actually they're doing everything they possibly can but I think also if small businesses are to increase their productivity they need the right economic environment in which to be able to invest they need to be able to have the money but to be able to afford to pay higher wages to their employees a and also the government has to of course accept some responsibility itself around infrastructure broadband under around to some of the other areas the deities responsible for ninety today we have seen the announcements on some of the major infrastructure projects that we need desperately in the north of England and elsewhere so we have got a church three announced we've got road improvements announced what we will be calling on the government now is to make sure that those announcements rush he delivered on the ground my charity federation small businesses here in the UK so does George Osborne's latest budget Harold brighter times ahead for prison I was one of our regular commentators the economist Roger Bootle even reality the economy's going to do what he's going to do anyways pretty much out of his hands he's separately trying to I think become more popular trying to win a few votes and pretend that if the economy does well it's down to have medical since does badly then it's down to the international economy suggesting that and and and plenty of governments got budget problems moment for one reason or another the tumbling oil price etcetera etcetera etcetera how do you assess the difficulties that the UK government is in at the moment in terms of deficit for example of the UK is faced a pretty big issue over government bargain she's difficult as this into perspective because is big the deficit got to very high levels over ten percent of GDP at peak the ratio government debt Judy pay rose very substantially got above eighteen but you know the other extreme if you go to avoid you go have a bonus went in Britain's history it's twice had a debt to GDP ratio of over two hundred and forty percent I think the long term average for brightness and I've got a theory of not so one shouldn't panic against that backdrop but the chancellor's task is being has to really try to get the deficit down to get to the point where the debt ratio peak too good full but without clobbering the economy so far I think he's done a reasonably good job but the deficit is still quite high in the debt ratio still rising he said to be a surplus in facts in the government budget in the year twenty twenty coincidently a general election year deeply thought I think it's possible because he's already five years late because he said the same thing in the last government by the end of the last parliament that be a budget deficit will be eliminated so is already behind the shed you are I think that's a fair chance of it but frankly it does all depend upon the economy what about this accelerated move to cut set the headline writer company taxes here in Britain it's going down eventually to seventeen percent by twenty twenty that compares with forty percent in the last thirty percent in Germany thirty three in France it is that the kind of move going easy if you like on business that would help a country's economy I think the chances probably doing the right thing with corporation tax of it's not clear to me that she going easy on business because they're quite a few areas in which is cutting back on the ability of companies to relieve the corporation tax burden Akashi trying to reject the system in order to minimize the chances of these large internationally mobile a company is not paying very much tax on the domestic operations corporation tax is really pretty daft tax to makes quite a sense to be moving in the direction of a lower rate of corporation tax but I'm quite sure that Mr Osborne's mind is the idea that put abolition two once the attractive prospect is if you can get that rate down they more more international companies might choose to locate will have their operations in Britain any thoughts on this sugar tax which is catching quite a few headlines here in the UK the south African government announced one during its latest budget a few weeks back and Mexico has it Sir an eye catching move I think it is quite nice because she moved move and it shows the conservative government adopting measures that you wouldn't normally associate actually with the conservatives that's to say thinking in terms of society overruled lights itself and benefits to the detriment of individual choice that's fully justifiable I think but turned the traditional conservative you would have paid well if people want to as it will kill themselves by eating too much sugar then that's their business this is another example of Mr old school I think moving very much towards the center which Beatle managing director of Catholic comics here in London who has been a mixed reaction to the British budgets on the London share market Chris speech emits IT markets joins me with the latest Chris let's go through the winners and losers in terms of shared values loses first predictably perhaps assert the prospect of the sugar tax isn't going down very well with investors yes a cheap on Britvic both key sugar producers or strict produces all of the stock market suffocation optically because of its are often gruesome was an iconic approach if you like right and what about the witness which company share prices rose in reaction to the UK budget quite a few actually are the oil attacks movement the beeping showed very well the softly we also had good pace the wealth manages an insurance firms like even generals this place because that use of boost nice element and also helps build as many because of what he didn't say he didn't and making major changes to the housing market bites letters we've seen before so that's why we had a good move from that sector to and as possibly summers to encourage building of new homes owner of our own land which is already being used cool brownfield land exactly cutting just a fair housing market to get moving and provides hope it was he continued demand for seat the hospital isn't what they provide alright let's move across the Atlantic now and many market eyes are on the US central bank the federal reserve making announcements in about what's a fifteen minutes time wise that was going at what's gonna happen well enough if it's making changes in interest rates was almost certainly won't move tool but they may provide more commission whether they'll continue to look to increase rates may be in June Anne December's was a market just awaiting their view of the US economy is strong enough and do they think they can aim to push on with this tightening cycle which means that that slow gradual raising interest rates yeah and that the the signs about the health of the US economy things at retail size Hemming grace have Tydeus economies hottie guy like a train no but it's it's getting out of the station if you like wages going up slowly but not quite the right we'd like Sir Jennylyn can be optimistic but she doesn't want to get too carried away without Chris thanks very much indeed as evidence crispy commits RG markets while the main share index here in London after all of that ended up no point six percent at six thousand one hundred and seventy five the Dow there is down at the moment about a fifth of a percent of seventeen thousand two hundred and fourteen currencies the euro as foreign backbeats against the US dollars one dollar ten point seven sense and the pounds twenty one dollar forty point nine that's a full for the pound about point six of a cent well the London Stock Exchange itself is also making headlines today that's because it's a great analogy with the main German share market Deutsche Boerse sent a new chapter in the colorful history of the stock exchange here in London which dates back almost three and a half centuries our portrait rams and commodity has been tracing some of that history and finding out what the much might mean for the city of London publicans are cold hail is a ride in the financial district of the I'd be is a very modern skyscraper the cheese grater around the corner is the back of it live and I'm walking to change and eight which is where Jonathan's because house used to be a and I was taught to match you great he's the author of books and wanted to travel quite three toy Matthews is a rather drab looking anyway occult believe this was the start of the love the stock exchange well don't be fooled by appearances the cease to be a hullabaloo of trade you had all sorts of high class outlets in here and you had three very famous coffee houses Lloyd's doorways and possibly the most famous of the moon Jonathan's coffeehouse which were standing outside now you would have seen as much as spilling out into the alley ways sealing deals you would've seen tradesman in the flame down swishing around you would've seen people selling why even coffee just outside alleyways in here even found a brick building which said open ground about sixty eight C. he would've walks in engulfed in a whirlwind of smoke and sweat and Steven and then you have sat down with your stock purchase and sets down the latest security crisis how did you all break up or they were killed off mainly by three things firstly tea iced tea arrived in the same country in the sixteen fifties but it was much more expensive because I had to be imported from further afield from China and was a high import cheesy but it's a lot of the jokes in the seventeen fifties this time the being lifted and it's becoming much more affordable secondly technological inventions like the telegraph I'm here in the in the early nineteen she you can transmit messages between sounds even but if oceans that renders obsolete the traditional coffeehouse cry of what niece of the unfriendly this evolution this trends towards evolution into private members clubs several top two pats lost a square which is in the heart of the city across Americans he supports cathedral which is pretty much the oldest building in the vicinity because everything around me is very large and very new and very clean that's not a square is also the home of the London Stock Exchange that is no coffeehouse inside and there's no trading floor if I want to go and see a trifle I have to go to one of the nearest investment banks or brokerage houses so now in a trading floor in the hall to the city it's a brokerage firm Samuel Gordon is got a hundred fifty year history I'm in front of him basically in a room the size of a small football pitch hundred people sitting in front of about four five screens in nature of lots of cut across and charts so I'm here with a veteran of the city I would say David Buchanan sake of you being heaven what's changed most embarrassed teddy runs of fifty three years and I've enjoyed every single but infertile and I've seen probably more changes than anybody else imaginable unholy top of the list is the way the stock exchange businesses been transacted all the stock brokers and insisted on nd the river four hundred and that of course is changed completely and everything is green things trade this deal between the love the stock exchanges torture is could be worth around thirty billion dollars that sounds absolutely massive what exactly are they going to achieve by doing this measure what they're trying to do is sex and endorse the fact that my personal global by doing a deal like this is a total acceptance that you have to be competitive and commercially and those cost savings are huge the company's estimate they could save up to Hoffa billion dollars by doing this merger but they've got quite a few hurdles to get over fast not only with the regulators but also persuading their shareholders that this is a good deal runs on Kamali reporting on all change in the world affixed now corruption has long been one of the biggest challenges for Nigeria home to Africa's largest economy last month the government removed almost twenty four thousand workers from its payroll after checks revealed that they didn't actually exist it's a phenomenon known as ghost workers now authorities in the northeastern state of balance she have discovered a whole new variety of ghost worker each year olds children being paid the salaries shes Dixie's a delight cara Abaqa in the capsule Abuja tell me more the boat you state government set up a committee to or did its work force that is to find out how many employees it has on his payroll and other end of the exercise discovered that thousands of people where ghost workers there where non existent in fact it was a shock to to find out that it's been NTL older children's names were found on the payroll **** teaches and there are huge sums of money were being paid to these are non existent workers the government said it realized about one point three billion naira through this exercise gosh that's very interesting and the government of course been trying to crack down all of this because government finances around a real strain with the falling oil price I suppose the question I have is what's to stop it happening again if the the people who are corrupt don't being waged outside thrown in jail find at central is plenty serious problem and it doesn't seem as if there is that political will to a deal with the issue because you know politicians there would always go back to the people for their support for their patronage and they feel that the only way the card what them or rather to the only way they can say thank you to give them money and generally politics here is all about money people don't think in terms of ideology in terms of what a politician has to offer militant in terms of what a politician offers them at that very moment that he wants they'll vote and so most of the politicians will go give money deal would give them food stuff you know majors of rice to cook and they get their vote so I it is quite a difficult thing to put a stop to Mosul budget also involves government officials perhaps it would even if it can be stopped it will take some years before now salaries were being paid by cash but because things have changed to make it faster and more transparent the government insisted that all employees must have bank accounts they must open bank accounts are through which their salaries will be paid and that even made it easier for these finance officials to include these fictitious names and then descended names too varios two shows bank account and then claim the money after like cara Abaqa speaking to me from a pitcher what is your idea of a perfect holiday lounging on a beach in the summer perhaps or maybe a spot of cultural cramming in the world speak cece's chilly though has decided that it wants to be a world leader in a different sort of tourism altogether strider tourism Chile apparently has some of the best conditions in the world for stargazing and as a starry eyed reported Jane chambers is being at discovering at the Thomas Elke hotel in northern Chile dnmt Thomas as key that's how fast a tourism in karaoke right you can see pretty amazing stars the great conditions it's got lots of little white dozens and you can actually go up stairs lie on your bed open the flap not kind to the stars but if you want to see them with a bit more clarity you can conduct tool and look for a very powerful back telescope I don't think wrongfully astronomy tour of if you don't support you're moving this telescope from position telling them with the style yeah no we are looking Beetlejuice is a red giant the Jews will be the next local star in collapse if this is the explosive today we will see the explosion intro six hundred and forty three years more and how can you tell that at such an old style cool basically renderer older and cooler bluer younger hotter six hours down south in the capital of Santiago I'm off to me popular Alvarez who's head of our street tourism chili he's just finished a project looking at how his country can become the world leader in this field you focus on optical astronomy at this moment Chile has forty percent of the most advanced infrastructure installed worldwide and the estimates is that with the big projects that are being built now that few will rise up to seventy in the next decade and why Chitty is a mixture of different conditions but its atmospheric conditions climate conditions even some political conditions and you need to have some minimum of political stability and so want to make a huge investment in scientific equipment tells to become the world leader in astro tourism Julius competing with places like the United States the Canary Islands and the United Kingdom in the next ten years published goal is to attract two million visitors per year in order to be able to do that he once said to be more visits available to the many scientific observer trees in the north of Chile which run by mix of states and foreign investors Wilhelm neither simple sequencing not the moment Tyrion Taurus make up seventy percent of the visitors are domiciled Claudia Leon is ready for the rest of the world last year foreign tourists until my forty percent glad you speak Spanish German and English and his business learning Chinese most of the people from from other countries usually come from retain Germany Holland and the last years has come many people from feast many Chinese people I am learning Chinese to so I'm here with one of the tourists he's on that tour with us Miami's inaudible came from Santiago to try to see the stars supposed to be to get the thing who are we and in this planet I think that we must try to learn everything all that report from Jane chambers in northern Chile business messages back later hold out of business news and comments Roger hearing will be with you for that's at one o'clock GMT but for me Mike Johnson that's all
