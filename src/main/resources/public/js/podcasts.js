    "text": "this is world business report from the BBC world service I\u0027m Suzanne is Theresa the aftermath of the deadly bomb attacks in Brussels just what effect will the attacks have on the region it\u0027s going to have serious repercussions all the way through the airlines train operators hoteliers and the millions of people in Europe who work in terrorism security is being stepped up across Europe but more stringent checks at apples will cost more will always be at risk of something new happening the only way around that would be for governments to more of the security operation and they currently do and I really don\u0027t see that happening found in Africa we have from firms generating power despite the lack of electricity we have to go and buy food first west I mean we can\u0027t have light but we need light so sick when we do more on that entrepreneur in Malawi coming up fineness Brussels is unlocked and following a series of deadly gun attacks two blondes tugs at the apple killing fourteen one med being carried out by a suicide bomber an hour later a bomb in the metro train in central Brussels killed about twenty people witnesses described harrowing scenes of passengers struggling to escape from right carriages that mobile station close to the European Union institutions with the full scale of the attacks emerging the Belgian prime minister shaman shall addressed his nation wouldn\u0027t you can also move more I would like to tell you we face a tragic moment a black moment for our country now more than ever I would like to appeal to old to be calm and to show solidarity we are confronted with a child a difficult challenge and we must face it by standing United showing solidarity and staying together also on the dole hustle Brussels is not just the heartache the EU it\u0027s also where many diplomatic missions are based on the headquarters of hundreds of international businesses many people had already arrived at work before the attacks took place peace determines is the chief executive of the federation of enterprises in Belgium he told me that workers were staying calm despite the chaotic scenes on the streets good morning of us of course a big surprise but most of people most of employers and their employees who are already in in Brussels so them most important problem that we are dealing with now is how we can get those employees back home this evening because for the moment the stations are closed to met was closed so we are looking for other dissolution Serbia sending messages to our members saying okay look for cooperating or other means to transport your country\u0027s Homer this this evening and I suppose the situation has been made more difficult because some phone networks of being blocks yeah well but for network yes were blocked but we can we were advised to communicate via social media what\u0027s up the viper a tweeter and so and and of course immediately afterwards our national telecom operators have opened their network to to all people for free and there was also free transportation by Texas in the in the region of Brussels so there was a huge solidarity between between let\u0027s say employers the hole on the one hand and please and and on the other hand because it\u0027s it was a very very sad day for for us today though absolutely this isn\u0027t the first articles that Brussels as being a lockdown after the Paris attack said the city was effectively close for a number of days so you the businesses that you worked with have had experience of that just how difficult is it to do business in a period of lockdown oversee many partners will be understanding but it will radio affect the way that Brussels candy business well into you notice that will be an issue to take over yet another Brussels and Brussels region is especially essay service based economy that means that you can easily have complex via kite be phone video conferences etcetera etcetera that\u0027s very much easier to do when the working in and service based economy to admit that in an industrial environment so I think it\u0027s it\u0027s an issue for Brussels for certain but we can continue to function as before because there are no other means to do so but it will have an impact that that foreshortened but unlike in November we handle it very well and we can we are a pretty resilient economy and there are many many headquarters here in Brussels and we will collaborate in the next issue it is also with the Richmond I\u0027m Chumley American chamber of commerce and the bridges Tim of commerce to see what what yes the best to do it so that we can Sam got some messages to also to those a month in ashes don\u0027t fear it stay in Brussels and to do business in Brussels and a bunch of and that was Jesus elements from the federation of enterprises in Belgium well following the blast Facebook activated it safety check feature which allows its users to check on friends in the city airlines have reviews of flights and many hotels across Brussels up also unlocked tab the landmark trump last was deserted with several museums and other top tourist destinations in the city\u0027s historic center closed I\u0027ll silent colder travel editor at the independent newspaper in the UK just what impact these attacks would have on Europe\u0027s travel industry crucially this struck at the departures area of Brussels airport in other words the so called remind side before the security check and you have this bizarre situation where this very intense security and to stop people hijacking or bombing aircraft yet anybody could until this morning wondering to Brussels airport unchecked in fact I was at a at Munich airport just last night it was ridiculous you could just step off the Espanto ran away into the airport area no checks and I was part of a massive queue waiting to get through passport control and security which from a terrorist point of view I\u0027m afraid presents a very tempting target the thing is though you could say that about any big kid around a football stadium outside a nightclub that kind of thing where you draw the line well of course and that that he\u0027s serious concern however transport any particular aviation seems to be the chosen arena for terrorists and I think we will see the kind of security that you get in places that have been a long history of terrorism such as Istanbul Nairobi Mumbai all of those airports everybody\u0027s checks before they are allowed anywhere near the terminal that\u0027s going to happen show our way of life in the west is as it were under attack but there are steps that can be taken and in the meantime the travel industry is just looking at this latest attack and and wondering how it is going to impact and I think on the number of people coming to Europe particularly from areas where starkly people have been sensitive such as North America such as Asia the important Japanese and Chinese markets they might well decide perhaps not to cancel their trips but not necessarily to to to book him for the year the coming summer it\u0027s going to have serious repercussions all the way and through the airlines that the train operators hoteliers and the millions of people in Europe who work in terrorism how long does it take for London to bounce back off to the seven seven bombings in two thousand and five it does take a few months I mean that was an awful summer of course I\u0027m in a sense London is different because it is such a huge business center issues such a a vostro it is also better connected than any other city on the planet and so therefore there was a bit more resilience I think places such as Brussels certainly Istanbul will I fear be more badly affected I\u0027m simply because I think these things are also so cumulative as it were prospective travelers will maybe say they\u0027ll discount one bond atrocity but then another one comes along and then another and another and it builds up a picture of a world which is profoundly dangerous it isn\u0027t I\u0027ll be looking at the numbers and travelers globally a safer than they have ever been in history that risks a lower per person that than they\u0027ve ever been however it certainly doesn\u0027t feel like that travel editor Simon colder that well countries across Europe is stepping up security in response in France sixteen hundred extra police will be deployed at key transport hubs Germany and the Netherlands are increasing checks at that borders the head of anti terrorism police in Britain set extra patrols are being deployed as a precaution Newman shanks was head of group security AppleScript PAN is now professor of aviation security at Coventry university in the UK he told me the beefing up security at airports might help but new screening technology wouldn\u0027t make much difference sadly the recent search technology available today that\u0027s you could screen passengers and their baggage open going through the traditional baggage screening process there is technology around will help you to screener and individual or group of people who may be carrying weapons or devices but we can\u0027t see inside bag suburban putting through an xray we couldn\u0027t call for a an initial check being carried out the front door all that would do is create congestion and they more attractive target for a different type of bombing or prenatal machine gun attack and the match I was also targets Hayes it would be very difficult to employ such screening technology and a transport hub Lika a railway station or metro witness E. S. from exactly the same problem you have firm areas where you could actually set up a security operation but the danger of that is you are setting up a launch equally unprotected area that some could be exploited by terrorists much more easy to do a drive by shooting or grenade attack then it would be inside the train station itself because what you\u0027re doing is you\u0027re moving the the target too much less secure area and it appears as if I\u0027ve the last few years there has been some kind of reluctance among some apple operators to continue with this high level security that we saw introduced since nine eleven in particular do you think that given these most recent attacks any kind of Fatah reticence on behalf of apples will fade away well two reasons for the reticence one is of the cost falls entirely down to the industry the airport operator who passes the cost on to the airline who then passes the costumes of the traveler very few governments actually contributes to the security costs so they are naturally trying to balance the budget in terms of what is an acceptable level of security to make the loans threats so it will always be at risk of something new happening the only way around that would be for governments to funds more of the security operation and they currently do and I really don\u0027t see that happening and that was professor aviation security no man shanks that\u0027s got an ages now from the financial markets and Brenda Kelly had it analyst at London capital group aides have Brenda was the market reaction in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on the immediate aftermath was around seven o\u0027clock in the morning and that was very much felt that would in the bond market where we saw big capital flow into like the German bond a gold was also at one of the beneficiaries of rose around one percent in the immediate aftermath of the news being released and then once the actual markets themselves opened we saw the real casualties which were really amongst other travel and leisure stocks the likes of easyjet Ryanair IAG Ole under significant pressure we only a couple of local producers actually in the green and the very early part of trade analysts deoxy warrant I we did I see a certain amount of pairing of those losses and while you know they were at one stage down around for a half percent those airline stocks to close the day and down from one to one and a half percent so it does show a certain amount of I suppose that resilience within the stock market and I think investors becoming a little bass and watching Dana possibly tolerant tip to such activities and events and that was a real defensive move ready plowing into gold was other stocks I\u0027ll see ms move a safe haven I will oversee gold is that it\u0027s a traditional safe haven and of course the likes of the currencies like the Japanese yen the Swiss franc world so very well that bit as well and bullets are really I think the market\u0027s actually ended the day up a little bit higher the footsteps echoed slightly higher in the day but again a lot of the actual stocks that were in the game were gaining for the defensive sectors the likes of the healthcare the staple sector like the supermarkets there were no real assertive at risk assets shall we say like growth or our our oil stocks and that were anyway and very much wild bed and of course as I said at the Kaufman leisure industry remained very very much under pressure I would more than likely continue to do so avatar has been the case over the last number of months particularly aftermath powers attacks as well and of course you\u0027ve had a few I suppose and if you guys said that the French and issue at the airport as well so all of the husband of volatility in those stocks are and in the year to date as well and I believe it was Thomas cook either a major UK travel firm that just one yesterday that it was a very volatile time for travel companies in particular yes it does certainly was quite recent of Thomas cook I but I think this is been something that has been out while flag but nobody hasn\u0027t expected to exist satanic degree of what happened in Brussels today and the fact that the airport remains closed and will more than likely remain close for the foreseeable future and what we will more than expected expect assailant volatility until we get a bit more clarity on what\u0027s been done about the incident okay Brenda Kelly had analyst at London capital group thanks very much for talking to us that we give you some of the latest numbers now from the financial markets and as Brenda was saying in London the one hundred chant exits up slightly point one percent to sixty one ninety three in New York the Dow is up point one percent at seventeen thousand six hundred and thirty two gold is trading at one thousand two hundred and forty eight dollars an ounce and on the currency markets the euro is that one dollar twelve point one U. S. that you\u0027re listening to wild visits reports on the BBC world service the weld radio station and a special good evening to listeners on ninety one point nine FM in Spain\u0027s Costa del sol we lays on talk radio your a giant of the technology world just one of the tributes to Andy Grove former CEO of Intel who\u0027s died age seventy nine he repelled Intel into becoming a household name in computers anti played a key role in the company shifted focus from memory chips to microprocessors he said his management philosophy of only the paranoid survive was inspired by living and dead **** occupation in Hungary in his youth his interview with him will cost a well business ripples in nineteen ninety five when he predicted a new era attack with a much I believe and actually if you are strongly about that is that the next frontier in the use of these general purpose prosecutors will be to use them for communication tasks specifically real time or live communication tasks sort of like and multimedia telephony people will use them to hold conferences both business conferences and personal social conferences with each other exchanged photographs here each other seeing each other all that click of a mouse on an icon over telephone lines I think he\u0027s got a new frontier for computing they can do it now but it\u0027s difficult ID have to modify the computers to do it now like so many other things forces multimedia the phenomenon takes off when the scalability comes built into every computer that you buy subject is there for you to use it and this will be something different from telephoning all using the internet as people use it at the moment will it it will be different from telephones in that it will be visual it will be multimedia not just voice it will be different from the internet which is multimedia or the worldwide web is multi media in that it will be live in real time so if you you know way what I\u0027m describing is the best of the two extreme walls of telephony and the worldwide web well it was Andy grows speaking to the BBC\u0027s pieces died back in nineteen ninety five pull Sappho is that technology focused are based in Silicon Valley he knew Andy Grove and I asked him how his up bringing in **** occupied Hungary affected access that\u0027s a fabulous question that\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve heard that question asked in your you\u0027ve really put your finger on something very important because success in Silicon Valley requires one to fully into the future just as fast as you can to take nothing for and I think that that\u0027s what one learns as a refugee is it you flee into the future if you take nothing for granted and Andy absolutely brought that kind perspective how do you think that was why Intel was able to identify those disruptors in the business and and seize on them and ands and exploit the melee course everything in Silicon Valley is team based and handy was successful because he had such a marvelous partnership with his colleagues at Intel but he\u0027s the one who pushed the hardest on saying we have got to push this business hard we have to keep going over the next horizon told identify and exploit the opportunities that others cannot even imagine because Intel could have been left behind ready just delivering chips instead he propelled the company towards micro processing and all that follows when you think about the origins of the personal computer he played an absolutely crucial role because he\u0027s the one who pushed Intel to turn microprocessors into a business and look for markets and without that there would have been no personal computer revolution we has a clip earlier in the program of him talking about his vision for the future and he said it would be worn why people would be exchanging photographs and talking to each other in real time over the internet he said using a click of the mouse in fact we\u0027ve using small bones really to do that but that was over twenty years ago that he may thoughtful costs and it\u0027s become true absolutely and a big reason why his vision became true was that he worked very hard to help make it true how would you sum up his contribution to technology he was an extraordinarily well rounded man the phrase renaissance man is yours tripe sounding but very true this is a gentleman who played a key role here developing technology roadmaps and that\u0027s what makes him stand out as there lots of people around all those elements but Andy was one of a very small number of people who actually combined all of them into a single person and that was cool Sappho a technology focus it keeps our computers running the phones charged and the lights on but can you imagine running a business without an electricity in many parts of the world that a lack of power is a very real situation for companies all across Africa governments is struggling to connect people to basic and reliable electrical services in Malawi any one in Tamil always has a connection in the rural areas it\u0027s about one in a hundred the BBC\u0027s Matt McGrath is that when I put it to him that must be very difficult for businesses to cut without electricity for much of the time it is indeed is not just the connection or disconnection from the electricity grid that\u0027s the problem it\u0027s the infrequency of electricity supplies when you are actually connected to the grid the papers publish lists of shut down power in particular is a show it\u0027s cut off and these can range from all four hundred in the morning till two in the afternoon and they\u0027ve several times we\u0027ve seen over the last couple days through the night and overnight as well so it\u0027s very difficult for businesses to cope with that having said that their love very enterprising people here and there and people are very good at using whatever meager supplies victories that they do guest set any specific examples well a particular example that comes to mind is a somebody we we visited and saw during the week here and that\u0027s a charity called solar array to sell a pay as you go solar package which involves a little amp and it\u0027s also a phone charger they sell it for about twelve U. S. dollars but they settled on the pay as you go system so that people actually pay down payment in the paid over the next couple months if they don\u0027t pay at though the company has that the ability to using the distributor smartphone to turn off the light to cut you off at source so a little earlier I spoke to a brave Mahoney who distributes these particular solar labs and I asked him to explain how it all worked so basically we tell customers how much the lamp cost and ask them to pay all the costs of thirty four months but if you don\u0027t pay in a particular month in that I\u0027m goes off but a much carry us how does that work out of a volcanic well how do you how do you control that I\u0027m friends from a distance this is computerized to be honest saw we send all information on the custom in December and then automatically if you pick something with links to the that the amount of blood that you get is a limited amount of money that you pay it\u0027s a very advanced technological system solution to something that you kind of think you\u0027ve got the cart before the horse here in the sense that you have a very advanced technology and computers to give people light is also need to go because whipping we can Manali systems is great and the biggest challenge ever on everybody\u0027s do have enough money to pay we have to go and buy food fest west I mean we can\u0027t have light but we need so that when we do she\u0027ll just focus on a small section of those who can afford not wait Whitley Chevrolet any charges by little solar panel that you touch to hear yes announce a very small and sort of I don\u0027t know I don\u0027t small tiny isn\u0027t an axe but so long and have the title checked up with after the final eight hours he\u0027s our guests included so what you wrote him during the day you leave us at home charges up and then at the night time you can have a light and also charge a fall so that was brave Mahoney who distributes those solar lights but what the government saying about what they can do the government says it\u0027s trying to open up the market for independent power providers they say that they\u0027re in talks with about twenty different groups to want to take part in providing private enterprise power if you like and the big difficulty of course is trust and the question of governance couple of years ago another was a big scandal here called cascade from enough of donor aid went missing and since then the donor agencies have kept back their money and that\u0027s accounts for about forty percent of the government\u0027s budget so there is really a lack of trust on behalf of the international community in the way that the government does things that may be improving but for the businesses who want to come in and set up and provide power the question marks over whether the government can actually meet its promises and conflict support them financially because nobody\u0027s going to come in here and provide power for nothing and those still I think remains big obstacles and that was not a crime in Malawi how had it welled business report was celebrating a very special birthday soon with details about how to join in the celebrations he\u0027s my colleague Richard callings dnmt nnj move on slicing a Chesney Hawkes we were the one and only an instant hit but was back in nineteen ninety one when will business report was born were you listening to us at the time twenty five years of past since we started will business report on the BBC world service now you can be part of our anniversary celebrations at the beginning of April we\u0027d like you to send in your memories of listening to us back in the early nineteen nineties is there any business story in particular that sticks in your mind the internet as we know it ample cast still hadn\u0027t been invented so did you listen to us on short wave send us your memories recorded as an MP three voice filed on either a smartphone or your computer to wilt business at BBC dot co dot UK by the thirty first of March these recording should be no longer than two minutes willing to broadcast the selection of them in another three programs you can also write to us with your memories at the same address just put anniversary in the subject title dnmt that if you get you can keep up to date with us as well on Twitter at BBC well Basil me at Susan St had to find out what stories were chasing and had the audio from you\u0027ve been listening to world business report from all of us here goodbye ",

on the region it\u0027s going to have serious repercussions all the way through the airlines train operators hoteliers and the millions of people in Europe who work in terrorism security is being stepped up across Europe but more stringent checks at apples will cost more will always be at risk of something new happening the only way around that would be for governments to more of the security operation and they currently do and I really don\u0027t see that happening found in Africa we have from firms generating power despite the lack of electricity we have to go and buy food first west I mean we can\u0027t have light but we need light so sick when we do more on that entrepreneur in Malawi coming up fineness Brussels is unlocked and following a series of deadly gun attacks two blondes tugs at the apple killing fourteen one med being carried out by a suicide bomber an hour later a bomb in the metro train in central Brussels killed about twenty people witnesses described harrowing scenes of passengers struggling to escape from right carriages that mobile station close to the European Union institutions with the full scale of the attacks emerging the Belgian prime minister shaman shall addressed his nation wouldn\u0027t you can also move more I would like to tell you we face a tragic moment a black moment for our country now more than ever I would like to appeal to old to be calm and to show solidarity we are confronted with a child a difficult challenge and we must face it by standing United showing solidarity and staying together also on the dole hustle Brussels is not just the heartache the EU it\u0027s also where many diplomatic missions are based on the headquarters of hundreds of international businesses many people had already arrived at work before the attacks took place peace determines is the chief executive of the federation of enterprises in Belgium he told me that workers were staying calm despite the chaotic scenes on the streets good morning of us of course a big surprise but most of people most of employers and their employees who are already in in Brussels so them most important problem that we are dealing with now is how we can get those employees back home this evening because for the moment the stations are closed to met was closed so we are looking for other dissolution Serbia sending messages to our members saying okay look for cooperating or other means to transport your country\u0027s Homer this this evening and I suppose the situation has been made more difficult because some phone networks of being blocks yeah well but for network yes were blocked but we can we were advised to communicate via social media what\u0027s up the viper a tweeter and so and and of course immediately afterwards our national telecom operators have opened their network to to all people for free and there was also free transportation by Texas in the in the region of Brussels so there was a huge solidarity between between let\u0027s say employers the hole on the one hand and please and and on the other hand because it\u0027s it was a very very sad day for for us today though absolutely this isn\u0027t the first articles that Brussels as being a lockdown after the Paris attack said the city was effectively close for a number of days so you the businesses that you worked with have had experience of that just how difficult is it to do business in a period of lockdown oversee many partners will be understanding but it will radio affect the way that Brussels candy business well into you notice that will be an issue to take over yet another Brussels and Brussels region is especially essay service based economy that means that you can easily have complex via kite be phone video conferences etcetera etcetera that\u0027s very much easier to do when the working in and service based economy to admit that in an industrial environment so I think it\u0027s it\u0027s an issue for Brussels for certain but we can continue to function as before because there are no other means to do so but it will have an impact that that foreshortened but unlike in November we handle it very well and we can we are a pretty resilient economy and there are many many headquarters here in Brussels and we will collaborate in the next issue it is also with the Richmond I\u0027m Chumley American chamber of commerce and the bridges Tim of commerce to see what what yes the best to do it so that we can Sam got some messages to also to those a month in ashes don\u0027t fear it stay in Brussels and to do business in Brussels and a bunch of and that was Jesus elements from the federation of enterprises in Belgium well following the blast Facebook activated it safety check feature which allows its users to check on friends in the city airlines have reviews of flights and many hotels across Brussels up also unlocked tab the landmark trump last was deserted with several museums and other top tourist destinations in the city\u0027s historic center closed I\u0027ll silent colder travel editor at the independent newspaper in the UK just what impact these attacks would have on Europe\u0027s travel industry crucially this struck at the departures area of Brussels airport in other words the so called remind side before the security check and you have this bizarre situation where this very intense security and to stop people hijacking or bombing aircraft yet anybody could until this morning wondering to Brussels airport unchecked in fact I was at a at Munich airport just last night it was ridiculous you could just step off the Espanto ran away into the airport area no checks and I was part of a massive queue waiting to get through passport control and security which from a terrorist point of view I\u0027m afraid presents a very tempting target the thing is though you could say that about any big kid around a football stadium outside a nightclub that kind of thing where you draw the line well of course and that that he\u0027s serious concern however transport any particular aviation seems to be the chosen arena for terrorists and I think we will see the kind of security that you get in places that have been a long history of terrorism such as Istanbul Nairobi Mumbai all of those airports everybody\u0027s checks before they are allowed anywhere near the terminal that\u0027s going to happen show our way of life in the west is as it were under attack but there are steps that can be taken and in the meantime the travel industry is just looking at this latest attack and and wondering how it is going to impact and I think on the number of people coming to Europe particularly from areas where starkly people have been sensitive such as North America such as Asia the important Japanese and Chinese markets they might well decide perhaps not to cancel their trips but not necessarily to to to book him for the year the coming summer it\u0027s going to have serious repercussions all the way and through the airlines that the train operators hoteliers and the millions of people in Europe who work in terrorism how long does it take for London to bounce back off to the seven seven bombings in two thousand and five it does take a few months I mean that was an awful summer of course I\u0027m in a sense London is different because it is such a huge business center issues such a a vostro it is also better connected than any other city on the planet and so therefore there was a bit more resilience I think places such as Brussels certainly Istanbul will I fear be more badly affected I\u0027m simply because I think these things are also so cumulative as it were prospective travelers will maybe say they\u0027ll discount one bond atrocity but then another one comes along and then another and another and it builds up a picture of a world which is profoundly dangerous it isn\u0027t I\u0027ll be looking at the numbers and travelers globally a safer than they have ever been in history that risks a lower per person that than they\u0027ve ever been however it certainly doesn\u0027t feel like that travel editor Simon colder that well countries across Europe is stepping up security in response in France sixteen hundred extra police will be deployed at key transport hubs Germany and the Netherlands are increasing checks at that borders the head of anti terrorism police in Britain set extra patrols are being deployed as a precaution Newman shanks was head of group security AppleScript PAN is now professor of aviation security at Coventry university in the UK he told me the beefing up security at airports might help but new screening technology wouldn\u0027t make much difference sadly the recent search technology available today that\u0027s you could screen passengers and their baggage open going through the traditional baggage screening process there is technology around will help you to screener and individual or group of people who may be carrying weapons or devices but we can\u0027t see inside bag suburban putting through an xray we couldn\u0027t call for a an initial check being carried out the front door all that would do is create congestion and they more attractive target for a different type of bombing or prenatal machine gun attack and the match I was also targets Hayes it would be very difficult to employ such screening technology and a transport hub Lika a railway station or metro witness E. S. from exactly the same problem you have firm areas where you could actually set up a security operation but the danger of that is you are setting up a launch equally unprotected area that some could be exploited by terrorists much more easy to do a drive by shooting or grenade attack then it would be inside the train station itself because what you\u0027re doing is you\u0027re moving the the target too much less secure area and it appears as if I\u0027ve the last few years there has been some kind of reluctance among some apple operators to continue with this high level security that we saw introduced since nine eleven in particular do you think that given these most recent attacks any kind of Fatah reticence on behalf of apples will fade away well two reasons for the reticence one is of the cost falls entirely down to the industry the airport operator who passes the cost on to the airline who then passes the costumes of the traveler very few governments actually contributes to the security costs so they are naturally trying to balance the budget in terms of what is an acceptable level of security to make the loans threats so it will always be at risk of something new happening the only way around that would be for governments to funds more of the security operation and they currently do and I really don\u0027t see that happening and that was professor aviation security no man shanks that\u0027s got an ages now from the financial markets and Brenda Kelly had it analyst at London capital group aides have Brenda was the market reaction in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on the immediate aftermath was around seven o\u0027clock in the morning and that was very much felt that would in the bond market where we saw big capital flow into like the German bond a gold was also at one of the beneficiaries of rose around one percent in the immediate aftermath of the news being released and then once the actual markets themselves opened we saw the real casualties which were really amongst other travel and leisure stocks the likes of easyjet Ryanair IAG Ole under significant pressure we only a couple of local producers actually in the green and the very early part of trade analysts deoxy warrant I we did I see a certain amount of pairing of those losses and while you know they were at one stage down around for a half percent those airline stocks to close the day and down from one to one and a half percent so it does show a certain amount of I suppose that resilience within the stock market and I think investors becoming a little bass and watching Dana possibly tolerant tip to such activities and events and that was a real defensive move ready plowing into gold was other stocks I\u0027ll see ms move a safe haven I will oversee gold is that it\u0027s a traditional safe haven and of course the likes of the currencies like the Japanese yen the Swiss franc world so very well that bit as well and bullets are really I think the market\u0027s actually ended the day up a little bit higher the footsteps echoed slightly higher in the day but again a lot of the actual stocks that were in the game were gaining for the defensive sectors the likes of the healthcare the staple sector like the supermarkets there were no real assertive at risk assets shall we say like growth or our our oil stocks and that were anyway and very much wild bed and of course as I said at the Kaufman leisure industry remained very very much under pressure I would more than likely continue to do so avatar has been the case over the last number of months particularly aftermath powers attacks as well and of course you\u0027ve had a few I suppose and if you guys said that the French and issue at the airport as well so all of the husband of volatility in those stocks are and in the year to date as well and I believe it was Thomas cook either a major UK travel firm that just one yesterday that it was a very volatile time for travel companies in particular yes it does certainly was quite recent of Thomas cook I but I think this is been something that has been out while flag but nobody hasn\u0027t expected to exist satanic degree of what happened in Brussels today and the fact that the airport remains closed and will more than likely remain close for the foreseeable future and what we will more than expected expect assailant volatility until we get a bit more clarity on what\u0027s been done about the incident okay Brenda Kelly had analyst at London capital group thanks very much for talking to us that we give you some of the latest numbers now from the financial markets and as Brenda was saying in London the one hundred chant exits up slightly point one percent to sixty one ninety three in New York the Dow is up point one percent at seventeen thousand six hundred and thirty two gold is trading at one thousand two hundred and forty eight dollars an ounce and on the currency markets the euro is that one dollar twelve point one U. S. that you\u0027re listening to wild visits reports on the BBC world service the weld radio station and a special good evening to listeners on ninety one point nine FM in Spain\u0027s Costa del sol we lays on talk radio your a giant of the technology world just one of the tributes to Andy Grove former CEO of Intel who\u0027s died age seventy nine he repelled Intel into becoming a household name in computers anti played a key role in the company shifted focus from memory chips to microprocessors he said his management philosophy of only the paranoid survive was inspired by living and dead **** occupation in Hungary in his youth his interview with him will cost a well business ripples in nineteen ninety five when he predicted a new era attack with a much I believe and actually if you are strongly about that is that the next frontier in the use of these general purpose prosecutors will be to use them for communication tasks specifically real time or live communication tasks sort of like and multimedia telephony people will use them to hold conferences both business conferences and personal social conferences with each other exchanged photographs here each other seeing each other all that click of a mouse on an icon over telephone lines I think he\u0027s got a new frontier for computing they can do it now but it\u0027s difficult ID have to modify the computers to do it now like so many other things forces multimedia the phenomenon takes off when the scalability comes built into every computer that you buy subject is there for you to use it and this will be something different from telephoning all using the internet as people use it at the moment will it it will be different from telephones in that it will be visual it will be multimedia not just voice it will be different from the internet which is multimedia or the worldwide web is multi media in that it will be live in real time so if you you know way what I\u0027m describing is the best of the two extreme walls of telephony and the worldwide web well it was Andy grows speaking to the BBC\u0027s pieces died back in nineteen ninety five pull Sappho is that technology focused are based in Silicon Valley he knew Andy Grove and I asked him how his up bringing in **** occupied Hungary affected access that\u0027s a fabulous question that\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve heard that question asked in your you\u0027ve really put your finger on something very important because success in Silicon Valley requires one to fully into the future just as fast as you can to take nothing for and I think that that\u0027s what one learns as a refugee is it you flee into the future if you take nothing for granted and Andy absolutely brought that kind perspective how do you think that was why Intel was able to identify those disruptors in the business and and seize on them and ands and exploit the melee course everything in Silicon Valley is team based and handy was successful because he had such a marvelous partnership with his colleagues at Intel but he\u0027s the one who pushed the hardest on saying we have got to push this business hard we have to keep going over the next horizon told identify and exploit the opportunities that others cannot even imagine because Intel could have been left behind ready just delivering chips instead he propelled the company towards micro processing and all that follows when you think about the origins of the personal computer he played an absolutely crucial role because he\u0027s the one who pushed Intel to turn microprocessors into a business and look for markets and without that there would have been no personal computer revolution we has a clip earlier in the program of him talking about his vision for the future and he said it would be worn why people would be exchanging photographs and talking to each other in real time over the internet he said using a click of the mouse in fact we\u0027ve using small bones really to do that but that was over twenty years ago that he may thoughtful costs and it\u0027s become true absolutely and a big reason why his vision became true was that he worked very hard to help make it true how would you sum up his contribution to technology he was an extraordinarily well rounded man the phrase renaissance man is yours tripe sounding but very true this is a gentleman who played a key role here developing technology roadmaps and that\u0027s what makes him stand out as there lots of people around all those elements but Andy was one of a very small number of people who actually combined all of them into a single person and that was cool Sappho a technology focus it keeps our computers running the phones charged and the lights on but can you imagine running a business without an electricity in many parts of the world that a lack of power is a very real situation for companies all across Africa governments is struggling to connect people to basic and reliable electrical services in Malawi any one in Tamil always has a connection in the rural areas it\u0027s about one in a hundred the BBC\u0027s Matt McGrath is that when I put it to him that must be very difficult for businesses to cut without electricity for much of the time it is indeed is not just the connection or disconnection from the electricity grid that\u0027s the problem it\u0027s the infrequency of electricity supplies when you are actually connected to the grid the papers publish lists of shut down power in particular is a show it\u0027s cut off and these can range from all four hundred in the morning till two in the afternoon and they\u0027ve several times we\u0027ve seen over the last couple days through the night and overnight as well so it\u0027s very difficult for businesses to cope with that having said that their love very enterprising people here and there and people are very good at using whatever meager supplies victories that they do guest set any specific examples well a particular example that comes to mind is a somebody we we visited and saw during the week here and that\u0027s a charity called solar array to sell a pay as you go solar package which involves a little amp and it\u0027s also a phone charger they sell it for about twelve U. S. dollars but they settled on the pay as you go system so that people actually pay down payment in the paid over the next couple months if they don\u0027t pay at though the company has that the ability to using the distributor smartphone to turn off the light to cut you off at source so a little earlier I spoke to a brave Mahoney who distributes these particular solar labs and I asked him to explain how it all worked so basically we tell customers how much the lamp cost and ask them to pay all the costs of thirty four months but if you don\u0027t pay in a particular month in that I\u0027m goes off but a much carry us how does that work out of a volcanic well how do you how do you control that I\u0027m friends from a distance this is computerized to be honest saw we send all information on the custom in December and then automatically if you pick something with links to the that the amount of blood that you get is a limited amount of money that you pay it\u0027s a very advanced technological system solution to something that you kind of think you\u0027ve got the cart before the horse here in the sense that you have a very advanced technology and computers to give people light is also need to go because whipping we can Manali systems is great and the biggest challenge ever on everybody\u0027s do have enough money to pay we have to go and buy food fest west I mean we can\u0027t have light but we need so that when we do she\u0027ll just focus on a small section of those who can afford not wait Whitley Chevrolet any charges by little solar panel that you touch to hear yes announce a very small and sort of I don\u0027t know I don\u0027t small tiny isn\u0027t an axe but so long and have the title checked up with after the final eight hours he\u0027s our guests included so what you wrote him during the day you leave us at home charges up and then at the night time you can have a light and also charge a fall so that was brave Mahoney who distributes those solar lights but what the government saying about what they can do the government says it\u0027s trying to open up the market for independent power providers they say that they\u0027re in talks with about twenty different groups to want to take part in providing private enterprise power if you like and the big difficulty of course is trust and the question of governance couple of years ago another was a big scandal here called cascade from enough of donor aid went missing and since then the donor agencies have kept back their money and that\u0027s accounts for about forty percent of the government\u0027s budget so there is really a lack of trust on behalf of the international community in the way that the government does things that may be improving but for the businesses who want to come in and set up and provide power the question marks over whether the government can actually meet its promises and conflict support them financially because nobody\u0027s going to come in here and provide power for nothing and those still I think remains big obstacles and that was not a crime in Malawi how had it welled business report was celebrating a very special birthday soon with details about how to join in the celebrations he\u0027s my colleague Richard callings dnmt nnj move on slicing a Chesney Hawkes we were the one and only an instant hit but was back in nineteen ninety one when will business report was born were you listening to us at the time twenty five years of past since we started will business report on the BBC world service now you can be part of our anniversary celebrations at the beginning of April we\u0027d like you to send in your memories of listening to us back in the early nineteen nineties is there any business story in particular that sticks in your mind the internet as we know it ample cast still hadn\u0027t been invented so did you listen to us on short wave send us your memories recorded as an MP three voice filed on either a smartphone or your computer to wilt business at BBC dot co dot UK by the thirty first of March these recording should be no longer than two minutes willing to broadcast the selection of them in another three programs you can also write to us with your memories at the same address just put anniversary in the subject title dnmt that if you get you can keep up to date with us as well on Twitter at BBC well Basil me at Susan St had to find out what stories were chasing and had the audio from you\u0027ve been listening to world business report from all of us here goodbye",

them into a single person and that was cool Sappho a technology focus it keeps our computers running the phones charged and the lights on but can you imagine running a business without an electricity in many parts of the world that a lack of power is a very real situation for companies all across Africa governments is struggling to connect people to basic and reliable electrical services in Malawi any one in Tamil always has a connection in the rural areas it\u0027s about one in a hundred the BBC\u0027s Matt McGrath is that when I put it to him that must be very difficult for businesses to cut without electricity for much of the time it is indeed is not just the connection or disconnection from the electricity grid that\u0027s the problem it\u0027s the infrequency of electricity supplies when you are actually connected to the grid the papers publish lists of shut down power in particular is a show it\u0027s cut off and these can range from all four hundred in the morning till two in the afternoon and they\u0027ve several times we\u0027ve seen over the last couple days through the night and overnight as well so it\u0027s very difficult for businesses to cope with that having said that their love very enterprising people here and there and people are very good at using whatever meager supplies victories that they do guest set any specific examples well a particular example that comes to mind is a somebody we we visited and saw during the week here and that\u0027s a charity called solar array to sell a pay as you go solar package which involves a little amp and it\u0027s also a phone charger they sell it for about twelve U. S. dollars but they settled on the pay as you go system so that people actually pay down payment in the paid over the next couple months if they don\u0027t pay at though the company has that the ability to using the distributor smartphone to turn off the light to cut you off at source so a little earlier I spoke to a brave Mahoney who distributes these particular solar labs and I asked him to explain how it all worked so basically we tell customers how much the lamp cost and ask them to pay all the costs of thirty four months but if you don\u0027t pay in a particular month in that I\u0027m goes off but a much carry us how does that work out of a volcanic well how do you how do you control that I\u0027m friends from a distance this is computerized to be honest saw we send all information on the custom in December and then automatically if you pick something with links to the that the amount of blood that you get is a limited amount of money that you pay it\u0027s a very advanced technological system solution to something that you kind of think you\u0027ve got the cart before the horse here in the sense that you have a very advanced technology and computers to give people light is also need to go because whipping we can Manali systems is great and the biggest challenge ever on everybody\u0027s do have enough money to pay we have to go and buy food fest west I mean we can\u0027t have light but we need so that when we do she\u0027ll just focus on a small section of those who can afford not wait Whitley Chevrolet any charges by little solar panel that you touch to hear yes announce a very small and sort of I don\u0027t know I don\u0027t small tiny isn\u0027t an axe but so long and have the title checked up with after the final eight hours he\u0027s our guests included so what you wrote him during the day you leave us at home charges up and then at the night time you can have a light and also charge a fall so that was brave Mahoney who distributes those solar lights but what the government saying about what they can do the government says it\u0027s trying to open up the market for independent power providers they say that they\u0027re in talks with about twenty different groups to want to take part in providing private enterprise power if you like and the big difficulty of course is trust and the question of governance couple of years ago another was a big scandal here called cascade from enough of donor aid went missing and since then the donor agencies have kept back their money and that\u0027s accounts for about forty percent of the government\u0027s budget so there is really a lack of trust on behalf of the international community in the way that the government does things that may be improving but for the businesses who want to come in and set up and provide power the question marks over whether the government can actually meet its promises and conflict support them financially because nobody\u0027s going to come in here and provide power for nothing and those still I think remains big obstacles and that was not a crime in Malawi how had it welled business report was celebrating a very special birthday soon with details about how to join in the celebrations he\u0027s my colleague Richard callings dnmt nnj move on slicing a Chesney Hawkes we were the one and only an instant hit but was back in nineteen ninety one when will business report was born were you listening to us at the time twenty five years of past since we started will business report on the BBC world service now you can be part of our anniversary celebrations at the beginning of April we\u0027d like you to send in your memories of listening to us back in the early nineteen nineties is there any business story in particular that sticks in your mind the internet as we know it ample cast still hadn\u0027t been invented so did you listen to us on short wave send us your memories recorded as an MP three voice filed on either a smartphone or your computer to wilt business at BBC dot co dot UK by the thirty first of March these recording should be no longer than two minutes willing to broadcast the selection of them in another three programs you can also write to us with your memories at the same address just put anniversary in the subject title dnmt that if you get you can keep up to date with us as well on Twitter at BBC well Basil me at Susan St had to find out what stories were chasing and had the audio from you\u0027ve been listening to world business report from all of us here goodbye",

on the region it\u0027s going to have serious repercussions all the way through the airlines train operators hoteliers and the millions of people in Europe who work in terrorism security is being stepped up across Europe but more stringent checks at apples will cost more will always be at risk of something new happening the only way around that would be for governments to more of the security operation and they currently do and I really don\u0027t see that happening found in Africa we have from firms generating power despite the lack of electricity we have to go and buy food first west I mean we can\u0027t have light but we need light so sick when we do more on that entrepreneur in Malawi coming up fineness Brussels is unlocked and following a series of deadly gun attacks two blondes tugs at the apple killing fourteen one med being carried out by a suicide bomber an hour later a bomb in the metro train in central Brussels killed about twenty people witnesses described harrowing scenes of passengers struggling to escape from right carriages that mobile station close to the European Union institutions with the full scale of the attacks emerging the Belgian prime minister shaman shall addressed his nation wouldn\u0027t you can also move more I would like to tell you we face a tragic moment a black moment for our country now more than ever I would like to appeal to old to be calm and to show solidarity we are confronted with a child a difficult challenge and we must face it by standing United showing solidarity and staying together also on the dole hustle Brussels is not just the heartache the EU it\u0027s also where many diplomatic missions are based on the headquarters of hundreds of international businesses many people had already arrived at work before the attacks took place peace determines is the chief executive of the federation of enterprises in Belgium he told me that workers were staying calm despite the chaotic scenes on the streets good morning of us of course a big surprise but most of people most of employers and their employees who are already in in Brussels so them most important problem that we are dealing with now is how we can get those employees back home this evening because for the moment the stations are closed to met was closed so we are looking for other dissolution Serbia sending messages to our members saying okay look for cooperating or other means to transport your country\u0027s Homer this this evening and I suppose the situation has been made more difficult because some phone networks of being blocks yeah well but for network yes were blocked but we can we were advised to communicate via social media what\u0027s up the viper a tweeter and so and and of course immediately afterwards our national telecom operators have opened their network to to all people for free and there was also free transportation by Texas in the in the region of Brussels so there was a huge solidarity between between let\u0027s say employers the hole on the one hand and please and and on the other hand because it\u0027s it was a very very sad day for for us today though absolutely this isn\u0027t the first articles that Brussels as being a lockdown after the Paris attack said the city was effectively close for a number of days so you the businesses that you worked with have had experience of that just how difficult is it to do business in a period of lockdown oversee many partners will be understanding but it will radio affect the way that Brussels candy business well into you notice that will be an issue to take over yet another Brussels and Brussels region is especially essay service based economy that means that you can easily have complex via kite be phone video conferences etcetera etcetera that\u0027s very much easier to do when the working in and service based economy to admit that in an industrial environment so I think it\u0027s it\u0027s an issue for Brussels for certain but we can continue to function as before because there are no other means to do so but it will have an impact that that foreshortened but unlike in November we handle it very well and we can we are a pretty resilient economy and there are many many headquarters here in Brussels and we will collaborate in the next issue it is also with the Richmond I\u0027m Chumley American chamber of commerce and the bridges Tim of commerce to see what what yes the best to do it so that we can Sam got some messages to also to those a month in ashes don\u0027t fear it stay in Brussels and to do business in Brussels and a bunch of and that was Jesus elements from the federation of enterprises in Belgium well following the blast Facebook activated it safety check feature which allows its users to check on friends in the city airlines have reviews of flights and many hotels across Brussels up also unlocked tab the landmark trump last was deserted with several museums and other top tourist destinations in the city\u0027s historic center closed I\u0027ll silent colder travel editor at the independent newspaper in the UK just what impact these attacks would have on Europe\u0027s travel industry crucially this struck at the departures area of Brussels airport in other words the so called remind side before the security check and you have this bizarre situation where this very intense security and to stop people hijacking or bombing aircraft yet anybody could until this morning wondering to Brussels airport unchecked in fact I was at a at Munich airport just last night it was ridiculous you could just step off the Espanto ran away into the airport area no checks and I was part of a massive queue waiting to get through passport control and security which from a terrorist point of view I\u0027m afraid presents a very tempting target the thing is though you could say that about any big kid around a football stadium outside a nightclub that kind of thing where you draw the line well of course and that that he\u0027s serious concern however transport any particular aviation seems to be the chosen arena for terrorists and I think we will see the kind of security that you get in places that have been a long history of terrorism such as Istanbul Nairobi Mumbai all of those airports everybody\u0027s checks before they are allowed anywhere near the terminal that\u0027s going to happen show our way of life in the west is as it were under attack but there are steps that can be taken and in the meantime the travel industry is just looking at this latest attack and and wondering how it is going to impact and I think on the number of people coming to Europe particularly from areas where starkly people have been sensitive such as North America such as Asia the important Japanese and Chinese markets they might well decide perhaps not to cancel their trips but not necessarily to to to book him for the year the coming summer it\u0027s going to have serious repercussions all the way and through the airlines that the train operators hoteliers and the millions of people in Europe who work in terrorism how long does it take for London to bounce back off to the seven seven bombings in two thousand and five it does take a few months I mean that was an awful summer of course I\u0027m in a sense London is different because it is such a huge business center issues such a a vostro it is also better connected than any other city on the planet and so therefore there was a bit more resilience I think places such as Brussels certainly Istanbul will I fear be more badly affected I\u0027m simply because I think these things are also so cumulative as it were prospective travelers will maybe say they\u0027ll discount one bond atrocity but then another one comes along and then another and another and it builds up a picture of a world which is profoundly dangerous it isn\u0027t I\u0027ll be looking at the numbers and travelers globally a safer than they have ever been in history that risks a lower per person that than they\u0027ve ever been however it certainly doesn\u0027t feel like that travel editor Simon colder that well countries across Europe is stepping up security in response in France sixteen hundred extra police will be deployed at key transport hubs Germany and the Netherlands are increasing checks at that borders the head of anti terrorism police in Britain set extra patrols are being deployed as a precaution Newman shanks was head of group security AppleScript PAN is now professor of aviation security at Coventry university in the UK he told me the beefing up security at airports might help but new screening technology wouldn\u0027t make much difference sadly the recent search technology available today that\u0027s you could screen passengers and their baggage open going through the traditional baggage screening process there is technology around will help you to screener and individual or group of people who may be carrying weapons or devices but we can\u0027t see inside bag suburban putting through an xray we couldn\u0027t call for a an initial check being carried out the front door all that would do is create congestion and they more attractive target for a different type of bombing or prenatal machine gun attack and the match I was also targets Hayes it would be very difficult to employ such screening

on the region it\u0027s going to have serious repercussions all the way through the airlines train operators hoteliers and the millions of people in Europe who work in terrorism security is being stepped up across Europe but more stringent checks at apples will cost more will always be at risk of something new happening the only way around that would be for governments to more of the security operation and they currently do and I really don\u0027t see that happening found in Africa we have from firms generating power despite the lack of electricity we have to go and buy food first west I mean we can\u0027t have light but we need light so sick when we do more on that entrepreneur in Malawi coming up fineness Brussels is unlocked and following a series of deadly gun attacks two blondes tugs at the apple killing fourteen one med being carried out by a suicide bomber an hour later a bomb in the metro train in central Brussels killed about twenty people witnesses described harrowing scenes of passengers struggling to escape from right carriages that mobile station close to the European Union institutions with the full scale of the attacks emerging the Belgian prime minister shaman shall addressed his nation wouldn\u0027t you can also move more I would like to tell you we face a tragic moment a black moment for our country now more than ever I would like to appeal to old to be calm and to show solidarity we are confronted with a child a difficult challenge and we must face it by standing United showing solidarity and staying together also on the dole hustle Brussels is not just the heartache the EU it\u0027s also where many diplomatic missions are based on the headquarters of hundreds of international businesses many people had already arrived at work before the attacks took place peace determines is the chief executive of the federation of enterprises in Belgium he told me that workers were staying calm despite the chaotic scenes on the streets good morning of us of course a big surprise but most of people most of employers and their employees who are already in in Brussels so them most important problem that we are dealing with now is how we can get those employees back home this evening because for the moment the stations are closed to met was closed so we are looking for other dissolution Serbia sending messages to our members saying okay look for cooperating or other means to transport your country\u0027s Homer this this evening and I suppose the situation has been made more difficult because some phone networks of being blocks yeah well but for network yes were blocked but we can we were advised to communicate via social media what\u0027s up the viper a tweeter and so and and of course immediately afterwards our national telecom operators have opened their network to to all people for free and there was also free transportation by Texas in the in the region of Brussels so there was a huge solidarity between between let\u0027s say employers the hole on the one hand and please and and on the other hand because it\u0027s it was a very very sad day for for us today though absolutely this isn\u0027t the first articles that Brussels as being a lockdown after the Paris attack said the city was effectively close for a number of days so you the businesses that you worked with have had experience of that just how difficult is it to do business in a period of lockdown oversee many partners will be understanding but it will radio affect the way that Brussels candy business well into you notice that will be an issue to take over yet another Brussels and Brussels region is especially essay service based economy that means that you can easily have complex via kite be phone video conferences etcetera etcetera that\u0027s very much easier to do when the working in and service based economy to admit that in an industrial environment so I think it\u0027s it\u0027s an issue for Brussels for certain but we can continue to function as before because there are no other means to do so but it will have an impact that that foreshortened but unlike in November we handle it very well and we can we are a pretty resilient economy and there are many many headquarters here in Brussels and we will collaborate in the next issue it is also with the Richmond I\u0027m Chumley American chamber of commerce and the bridges Tim of commerce to see what what yes the best to do it so that we can Sam got some messages to also to those a month in ashes don\u0027t fear it stay in Brussels and to do business in Brussels and a bunch of and that was Jesus elements from the federation of enterprises in Belgium well following the blast Facebook activated it safety check feature which allows its users to check on friends in the city airlines have reviews of flights and many hotels across Brussels up also unlocked tab the landmark trump last was deserted with several museums and other top tourist destinations in the city\u0027s historic center closed I\u0027ll silent colder travel editor at the independent newspaper in the UK just what impact these attacks would have on Europe\u0027s travel industry crucially this struck at the departures area of Brussels airport in other words the so called remind side before the security check and you have this bizarre situation where this very intense security and to stop people hijacking or bombing aircraft yet anybody could until this morning wondering to Brussels airport unchecked in fact I was at a at Munich airport just last night it was ridiculous you could just step off the Espanto ran away into the airport area no checks and I was part of a massive queue waiting to get through passport control and security which from a terrorist point of view I\u0027m afraid presents a very tempting target the thing is though you could say that about any big kid around a football stadium outside a nightclub that kind of thing where you draw the line well of course and that that he\u0027s serious concern however transport any particular aviation seems to be the chosen arena for terrorists and I think we will see the kind of security that you get in places that have been a long history of terrorism such as Istanbul Nairobi Mumbai all of those airports everybody\u0027s checks before they are allowed anywhere near the terminal that\u0027s going to happen show our way of life in the west is as it were under attack but there are steps that can be taken and in the meantime the travel industry is just looking at this latest attack and and wondering how it is going to impact and I think on the number of people coming to Europe particularly from areas where starkly people have been sensitive such as North America such as Asia the important Japanese and Chinese markets they might well decide perhaps not to cancel their trips but not necessarily to to to book him for the year the coming summer it\u0027s going to have serious repercussions all the way and through the airlines that the train operators hoteliers and the millions of people in Europe who work in terrorism how long does it take for London to bounce back off to the seven seven bombings in two thousand and five it does take a few months I mean that was an awful summer of course I\u0027m in a sense London is different because it is such a huge business center issues such a a vostro it is also better connected than any other city on the planet and so therefore there was a bit more resilience I think places such as Brussels certainly Istanbul will I fear be more badly affected I\u0027m simply because I think these things are also so cumulative as it were prospective travelers will maybe say they\u0027ll discount one bond atrocity but then another one comes along and then another and another and it builds up a picture of a world which is profoundly dangerous it isn\u0027t I\u0027ll be looking at the numbers and travelers globally a safer than they have ever been in history that risks a lower per person that than they\u0027ve ever been however it certainly doesn\u0027t feel like that travel editor Simon colder that well countries across Europe is stepping up security in response in France sixteen hundred extra police will be deployed at key transport hubs Germany and the Netherlands are increasing checks at that borders the head of anti terrorism police in Britain set extra patrols are being deployed as a precaution Newman shanks was head of group security AppleScript PAN is now professor of aviation security at Coventry university in the UK he told me the beefing up security at airports might help but new screening technology wouldn\u0027t make much difference sadly the recent search technology available today that\u0027s you could screen passengers and their baggage open going through the traditional baggage screening process there is technology around will help you to screener and individual or group of people who may be carrying weapons or devices but we can\u0027t see inside bag suburban putting through an xray we couldn\u0027t call for a an initial check being carried out the front door all that would do is create congestion and they more attractive target for a different type of bombing or prenatal machine gun attack and the match I was also targets Hayes it would be very difficult to employ such screening technology and a transport hub Lika a railway station or metro witness E. S. from exactly the same problem you have firm areas where you could actually set up a security operation but the danger of that is you are setting up a launch equally unprotected area that some could be exploited by terrorists much more easy to do a drive by shooting or grenade attack then it would be inside the train station itself because what you\u0027re doing is you\u0027re moving the the target too much less secure area and it appears as if I\u0027ve the last few years there has been some kind of reluctance among some apple operators to continue with this high level security that we saw introduced since nine eleven in particular do you think that given these most recent attacks any kind of Fatah reticence on behalf of apples will fade away well two reasons for the reticence one is of the cost falls entirely down to the industry the airport operator who passes the cost on to the airline who then passes the costumes of the traveler very few governments actually contributes to the security costs so they are naturally trying to balance the budget in terms of what is an acceptable level of security to make the loans threats so it will always be at risk of something new happening the only way around that would be for governments to funds more of the security operation and they currently do and I really don\u0027t see that happening and that was professor aviation security no man shanks that\u0027s got an ages now from the financial markets and Brenda Kelly had it analyst at London capital group aides have Brenda was the market reaction in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on the immediate aftermath was around seven o\u0027clock in the morning and that was very much felt that would in the bond market where we saw big capital flow into like the German bond a gold was also at one of the beneficiaries of rose around one percent in the immediate aftermath of the news being released and then once the actual markets themselves opened we saw the real casualties which were really amongst other travel and leisure stocks the likes of easyjet Ryanair IAG Ole under significant pressure we only a couple of local producers actually in the green and the very early part of trade analysts deoxy warrant I we did I see a certain amount of pairing of those losses and while you know they were at one stage down around for a half percent those airline stocks to close the day and down from one to one and a half percent so it does show a certain amount of I suppose that resilience within the stock market and I think investors becoming a little bass and watching Dana possibly tolerant tip to such activities and events and that was a real defensive move ready plowing into gold was other stocks I\u0027ll see ms move a safe haven I will oversee gold is that it\u0027s a traditional safe haven and of course the likes of the currencies like the Japanese yen the Swiss franc world so very well that bit as well and bullets are really I think the market\u0027s actually ended the day up a little bit higher the footsteps echoed slightly higher in the day but again a lot of the actual stocks that were in the game were gaining for the defensive sectors the likes of the healthcare the staple sector like the supermarkets there were no real assertive at risk assets shall we say like growth or our our oil stocks and that were anyway and very much wild bed and of course as I said at the Kaufman leisure industry remained very very much under pressure I would more than likely continue to do so avatar has been the case over the last number of months particularly aftermath powers attacks as well and of course you\u0027ve had a few I suppose and if you guys said that the French and issue at the airport as well so all of the husband of volatility in those stocks are and in the year to date as well and I believe it was Thomas cook either a major UK travel firm that just one yesterday that it was a very volatile time for travel companies in particular yes it does certainly was quite recent of Thomas cook I but I think this is been something that has been out while flag but nobody hasn\u0027t expected to exist satanic degree of what happened in Brussels today and the fact that the airport remains closed and will more than likely remain close for the foreseeable future and what we will more than expected expect assailant volatility until we get a bit more clarity on what\u0027s been done about the incident okay Brenda Kelly had analyst at London capital group thanks very much for talking to us that we give you some of the latest numbers now from the financial markets and as Brenda was saying in London the one hundred chant exits up slightly point one percent to sixty one ninety three in New York the Dow is up point one percent at seventeen thousand six hundred and thirty two gold is trading at one thousand two hundred and forty eight dollars an ounce and on the currency markets the euro is that one dollar twelve point one U. S. that you\u0027re listening to wild visits reports on the BBC world service the weld radio station and a special good evening to listeners on ninety one point nine FM in Spain\u0027s Costa del sol we lays on talk radio your a giant of the technology world just one of the tributes to Andy Grove former CEO of Intel who\u0027s died age seventy nine he repelled Intel into becoming a household name in computers anti played a key role in the company shifted focus from memory chips to microprocessors he said his management philosophy of only the paranoid survive was inspired by living and dead **** occupation in Hungary in his youth his interview with him will cost a well business ripples in nineteen ninety five when he predicted a new era attack with a much I believe and actually if you are strongly about that is that the next frontier in the use of these general purpose prosecutors will be to use them for communication tasks specifically real time or live communication tasks sort of like and multimedia telephony people will use them to hold conferences both business conferences and personal social conferences with each other exchanged photographs here each other seeing each other all that click of a mouse on an icon over telephone lines I think he\u0027s got a new frontier for computing they can do it now but it\u0027s difficult ID have to modify the computers to do it now like so many other things forces multimedia the phenomenon takes off when the scalability comes built into every computer that you buy subject is there for you to use it and this will be something different from telephoning all using the internet as people use it at the moment will it it will be different from telephones in that it will be visual it will be multimedia not just voice it will be different from the internet which is multimedia or the worldwide web is multi media in that it will be live in real time so if you you know way what I\u0027m describing is the best of the two extreme walls of telephony and the worldwide web well it was Andy grows speaking to the BBC\u0027s pieces died back in nineteen ninety five pull Sappho is that technology focused are based in Silicon Valley he knew Andy Grove and I asked him how his up bringing in **** occupied Hungary affected access that\u0027s a fabulous question that\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve heard that question asked in your you\u0027ve really put your finger on something very important because success in Silicon Valley requires one to fully into the future just as fast as you can to take nothing for and I think that that\u0027s what one learns as a refugee is it you flee into the future if you take nothing for granted and Andy absolutely brought that kind perspective how do you think that was why Intel was able to identify those disruptors in the business and and seize on them and ands and exploit the melee course everything in Silicon Valley is team based and handy was successful because he had such a marvelous partnership with his colleagues at Intel but he\u0027s the one who pushed the hardest on saying we have got to push this business hard we have to keep going over the next horizon told identify and exploit the opportunities that others cannot even imagine because Intel could have been left behind ready just delivering chips instead he propelled the company towards micro processing and all that follows when you think about the origins of the personal computer he played an absolutely crucial role because he\u0027s the one who pushed Intel to turn microprocessors into a business and look for markets and without that there would have been no personal computer revolution we has a clip earlier in the program of him talking about his vision for the future and he said it would be worn why people would be exchanging photographs and talking to each other in real time over the internet he said using a click of the mouse in fact we\u0027ve using small bones really to do that but that was over twenty years ago that he may thoughtful costs and it\u0027s become true absolutely and a big reason why his vision became true was that he worked very hard to help make it true how would you sum up his contribution to technology he was an extraordinarily well rounded man the phrase renaissance man is yours tripe sounding but very true this is a gentleman who played a key role here developing technology roadmaps and that\u0027s what makes him stand out as there lots of people around all those elements but Andy was one of a very small number of people who actually combined all of them into a single person and that was cool Sappho a technology focus it keeps our computers running the phones charged and the lights on but can you imagine running a business without an electricity in many parts of the world that a lack of power is a very real situation for companies all across Africa governments is struggling to connect people to basic and reliable electrical services in Malawi any one in Tamil always has a connection in the rural areas it\u0027s about one in a hundred the BBC\u0027s Matt McGrath is that when I put it to him that must be very difficult for businesses to cut without electricity for much of the time it is indeed is not just the connection or disconnection from the electricity grid that\u0027s the problem it\u0027s the infrequency of electricity supplies when you are actually connected to the grid the papers publish lists of shut down power in particular is a show it\u0027s cut off and these can range from all four hundred in the morning till two in the afternoon and they\u0027ve several times we\u0027ve seen over the last couple days through the night and overnight as well so it\u0027s very difficult for businesses to cope with that having said that their love very enterprising people here and there and people are very good at using whatever meager supplies victories that they do guest set any specific examples well a particular example that comes to mind is a somebody we we visited and saw during the week here and that\u0027s a charity called solar array to sell a pay as you go solar package which involves a little amp and it\u0027s also

S. government banned the prevented American tourists from visiting the island it\u0027s just ninety miles south of Florida nnj last week president Obama relaxed the restrictions and U. S. visitor numbers is soon expected to skyrocket Cuba is already experiencing a tourism boom last year international visitors jumped seventeen percent to a record three point five million earlier this month I joined the throng and noticed a certain sense of urgency among fellow travelers Leninist dice I\u0027m twenty nine years old and I\u0027m from Holland and when you visit right now it\u0027s still authentic and when you wait a few years one and and and bonds with America are getting better then the authentic you basis we think it much more difficult to see so that\u0027s why we came out and my name is custom when I come from Germany we decided to come here and now I\u0027m not to wait much longer because the changes happening right now and we want to see the real Cuba before the Americans come when the yeah that\u0027s what we why why we decided to come here nnj the village of the neon eight seats in a quiet valley surrounded by flattop mountains it seemed to rise almost vertically out of the red at the green tobacco plantations which this area in the west of Cuba is famous the populist up on the tourist circuit and tourists are everywhere to be seen lining up outside the bank on the main street to change yet more money into pincers fulfilling one of the many tourist buses headed to the nearby caves houses in been yali fell all brightly painted each one is yellow pink green orange and invariably they come with two rocking chairs on the front porch and on every house that I\u0027ve seen in this village that the blue symbol that denotes this is a concept tequila or a house where rooms can be privately rented twenty four year old junior guy out of Topeka manages four rooms and bananas I oughta apply me into nowadays at present no more than five hundred houses some houses with two or three rings up for rent very many houses because tourism last year and this year has grown greatly so they need places to accommodate melodic nnova Anna\u0027s famous Pronto runs from one end of the city it is a wide Boulevard beautiful park in the center its streets are lined with fine show back in the capital those fine shops along gone instead tourists today flock to see the city\u0027s crumbling architectural gems steel memorial to Che Guevara in revolution square and the classic cars bought before the U. S. trade embargo still clinging to life as taxis Blanca Rodriguez has been renting out rooms in her house in old Havana for five years Alana a need to suit the mood will sign you know in the past two years tourism has really been booming we\u0027ve really busy I think that once the news broke about diplomatic ties being restored between the United States and Cuba it led to a huge increase in tourism lots of tourists think that keep is going to change when the relationship with America improves do you think they\u0027re right or wrong you don\u0027t if Leno in this for us it\u0027s kidneys the Americans come and get to know Cuba and for us to get to know American people we have no complaints against sin and we haven\u0027t any bad feelings despite all the years the trade and economic Wagner when Tom we know it\u0027s not the people\u0027s fault it was the fault of the government\u0027s so I really pleased if many more American tourists keep coming to get to know our country longer Rodriguez is in the only one looking forward to an increase in U. S. businesses robin Hayes is the CEO of jet blue annoy frills American airline when we think about the potential for Havana and Cuba it\u0027s really fast it could easily become the largest market in the cabin and the American aviation industry is vying for access to the new route you know this is the biggest rout a decision of making process the department so we have lines are fighting a selves to get in two I have excluding JetBlue because it\u0027s such a great opportunity for all of us so is this the end of Cuba\u0027s distinctly non American flavor dnmt Leno and I\u0027m very proud of wetness given people are not going to we have our own culture our own identity on musical roots and and quacks the method of about one hundred drinking a coke or eating a McDonald\u0027s is not going to change the way I am it\u0027s not going to change our identity dnmt is nndb no nnj yeah pulls from Vivienne newness well among the business deals president Obama is trying to advance during his trip is connecting Cuban entrepreneurs with U. S. tech companies anonymous Reno is a director of the American society in council of the Americas a Latin American policy think tank I asked to hug just after she arrived in Cuba about the communications and she said he was still very difficult people have a long way to go to global standards and internet connectivity and it has a very low rate application equipment household underrated slightly higher I\u0027m I\u0027m looking for a government agent says well I think you know why we take a big step forward in terms of use roaming agreement to being able to actually talk you know while waiting for the day when we can counting Cuba over our concerns and actually you can pretty talented in April and acting out like well Google is one of the fans planning to help develop internet services on the island Jason mark Zach is director of the Latin American economic growth initiative at the Atlantic council in Washington DC he told me tales another sectors was still a way off because although there\u0027s been some tinkering the trade embargo between the US and Cuba is still in place in order for there to be full free trade we need to remove the embargo the what the president\u0027s done over the course the last fifteen months is chip away at aspects of the embargo but the embargo remains fully in place the developments that we\u0027ve seen this rail flooring of relations do you think it will still make a dramatic difference to the lives of of ordinary Cubans so far the very fact that I suppose that most toys can can arrive freely in the country yes we\u0027ve seen a dramatic increase in US tourists in two thousand fifteen that will continue to increase this year there those terrorists eat at restaurants that are owned by more than five hundred thousand Floyd Cubans those tourist tip taxi drivers tip bartenders are those jurors get money directly to the Cuban people in addition because of that increased tourism we\u0027ve seen things like Airbnb now operating Cuba as also being a bit of a rush of tourists to come visit the island before they felt that said that be a a real American influence over in the future do you think that will happen and the keeper that we see today will just changed completely frankly we\u0027ve already seen the key but Cuba changing because of the influx of tourists for example Cuba now has wifi spots available on with eighty new spots opening up this year those types of I\u0027m services are things that tourists demand there\u0027s there things that American businesses wants more access to the internet and those benefits then filter to the Cuban people as well but do you think that will still be resistance from Havana and a loss of regulation put in place to stop too much of a US influence over its economy and the way of life in Cuba yeah I think that we will see resistance from the accu been regime the Cubans are apprehensive about quick change on the island but despite that change and granting people greater each liberties is a basic human right for the people well that was Jason marks act that set of Latin America economic growth initiative at the Atlantic council in Washington DC you\u0027re listening to while business report from the BBC world service still to come on honesty is always the best policy in the corporate world you can never admits to not enjoying the job instead you must insist that it\u0027s stimulating and going well and that you are entirely and control my chairman is an idiot is something often thought which must never be offset more from Lucy Callaway coming up investigators in China have uncovered a huge illegal vaccine operation involving hospitals and health centers across the country China\u0027s drug regulators working to trace the whereabouts of almost nineteen million dollars worth of vaccines it said that because they were in properly stored some could cause disability what even death the ring leaders have been arrested were allegedly a mother and a daughter who purchased the vaccines from licensed and unlicensed sources and then sold them on at high prices the scandal has caused widespread anger because it so much that the authorities had been a wet the operation for some time the BBC\u0027s Chinese service and satisfying chatting Toby more about how the story unmatched the case is being going on for years now nearly it was discovered back in April last year it was first reported this Friday only last Friday that\u0027s why the cost fusion from Chinese public saying Howdy authorities keep applying island that and because he\u0027s has it threatens people\u0027s health and especially babies and that water is the parents and mommies and Daddies souls very much so at the moment simply because they don\u0027t know whether to take their children to be vaccinated because until shoal whether the vaccines held at the local hospital will be safe exactly I mean de affected vaccinations is reported as an effective in twenty four provinces and that municipalities in China\u0027s huge area no one knows where they are now that\u0027s why do authorities asked to Tracy down he did give a deadline of this Friday for those who get involved especially Asians especially the health centers to come forward to provide their names and Asians so that police can track him down and it would be any agents all health centers who had contacts with this particular mother and daughter who apparently her at the center of this operation yes I mean this particular at lady and she\u0027s forty seven year old she once worked as a doctor in the local hospital packing two thousand nine what extraordinary is that she was already sentenced three years in prison with five year suspension and because of the same thing yes she was convicted alpha Huff illegal selling T. vaccination and now people Askari why for second time around should do the same thing to it even greater scale that I love and hate a million Bucks exactly so nice wide to people also criticize the government saying that as a regulator as the government has already emphasize how important it is for food and safety related to people\u0027s health steel prying I would tend to and this case is not be discovered earlier is that not that the faster health and safety scatter in China of course many people remember the baby milk scandal will happen that the baby milk scandal happened in two thousand eight right after the Beijing Olympics and exploded across them in the nation and even chance top leaders asked the severe punishment for those involved but I think that severe punishment has not put people stop from doing it we can see the latest cases and together with many other cases especially China China\u0027s gonna want without severe punishment including back in two thousand seven de director for food and saved at the next administration was executed for corruption so I think because of the huge profiting involved because of the regulation especially implementation awful or those rules and regulations I\u0027m not fully adhere to that\u0027s why people want to take the risk to make a profit so far have that been any deaths recorded co incidentally today the reason report in south China\u0027s Guangdong province a four year bowl he died after vaccination but authorities cameras immediacy clear himself saying that it has nothing to do with state latest vaccination but we\u0027re not sure and the public is still very doubt about it Cummings I\u0027d say and that was the BBC Chinese service editor shrunk chatter that story spot fury on social media with thousands of users on the Weibo network talking about the scandal huevo ism microblogging service which has eclipsed Twitter in China attracting almost a third of all web uses that the competition is becoming tougher Twista which celebrates a milestone today it\u0027s ten years since the first ever tweet was sent the one hundred forty carries a message was an instant hit that it wasn\u0027t any game until someone use the service at a technology festival as the site\u0027s co founder biz stone explains most of the story geeks and nerds go to the interactive festival they network they party there was a guy who is a crowded bar in downtown Austin Texas and he wanted to be able to talk more with his friends that part was just too loud and crowded so we sent out a tweet that said let\u0027s go to this other Barney named it and in the eight or ten minutes it took him to walk to that bar it had completely filled to capacity there\u0027s a line out the door well after that it all took off out of the past decade to which he has played a significant role in revolutionizing communication journalism and politics but its stock market value has fallen because of concerns about its ability to attract new users and advertises Patrick Smith is a proposed at buzzfeed he\u0027s been on Twitter since the early days he very much felt that there was no dividing line between the normal people and celebrities and sports doesn\u0027t reprimand be trapped early on of ice to talk to Stephen fry a very famous a British actor and writer star of fed the small screen also and he\u0027s also a big guy techno file and an early adopter and he was one of the people who quite early on used to it\u0027s just explain what he was doing and instead I just his thoughts on things and we it was confirmed by them though it\u0027s a very different face Stephen fry if left to itself because he says it\u0027s that no longer a magical pool instead it\u0027s this huge city full of trolls and dole says the company is having problems attracting enough advertisers the problem is that I have the eternal digital media conundrum that that people have faced since the dawn of the incident really which is to what extent do you sell your uses attention for financial gain and to what extent do you leave advertising free because you just don\u0027t tend to like outside especially when into ropes that service and and this is the problem that\u0027s what the house now I\u0027m thinking creasing the we might see more ok first on our time line but I have to diversify and think about how to use things like images and video making on the future rather than just interrupting someone and say Hey here\u0027s a sponsor to eat at the same time they have competition with the likes of we voted in China Snapchat\u0027s all kind of latest death pretenders to the throne how do they still gain new uses thus it interesting question and I think in the long term macroeconomic picture that the rights of something like when he spoke and I know Russian site a few cable called I think how they are combatant rice and beans non English services is actually really big question I don\u0027t think that I have announced to how\u0027d you get new uses I think firstly you need to make the service simpler you to look at what Facebook stone and as soon as you sign up to Facebook it\u0027s clear why you\u0027re fat and how you doing you answer the question how you feeling or what you\u0027re doing today Facebook actually asked you that question where is when you\u0027re on Twitter people\u0027s first reaction is often why am I here what do I do now and unless you are a journalist or an analyst or politician or somebody who disseminates information for a living he can often feel quite an abstract place to be you know quite sure what what you do next time interrupt with people and I believe the vast majority pretty uses Sino made to treat once a twice and then never return when that was at peace Smith from buzzfeed best check in with a financial markets now and speak to act like a carry a fidelity international highlighted that live in my because so tell me would be in the movie is on the London exchange today because it didn\u0027t do so well as the other European induces did it despite that we found that we saw in China unidentified two hundred pigeons pitch appendix room minds hostage to the fortunes of commodities and the largest commodity companies now despite the recent week seeing a rebound in a lot of commodity companies and and many people saying oh are we seeing the first green shoots of recovery at this week things are looking a lot different the biggest for us today Anglo American dealing Cole I have concerns of a fresh supply glut in oil has once again white of the oil price and that of course is hit the likes of shall and BP the big thing to look at his review the dollar because as we know commodity commodities in the dollar have it inverse relationship over the dollar weakening last week that was a boost to commodity company and also there\u0027s been quite a bit of movement as far as retail stocks are concerned and that\u0027s our retail giant Sainsbury\u0027s in the UK a sh goodness aloft a south African firms that it didn\u0027t actually work to to buy a fund that is interested in so lots of movement in the international retells that\u0027s France\u0027s centuries price up slightly today as it\u0027s finally kid that deal with home retail group and and specifically and it had its eyes on August which is part of the group because it wants to invest more in the internet delivery Stein of was a competitor lurking in the background but Stein of has confirmed today that it is not interested anymore lots of movement that okay thank you very much Mikey carry from fidelity let me give you some latest numbers now from the financial markets the footsie one hundred index was down five points at sixty one eighty four down point eight essentials hunger in New York the Dow Jones was up by twenty points whole point one two percent at some two thousand six hundred and twenty three you\u0027re listening to well business reports on the BBC world service and it\u0027s a special good evening to our listeners on digital short wave of DRM in India on five point eight four five megahertz now honesty as the old saying goes is the best policy knocks it seems when you\u0027re the boss of a company every trabecular comes as in DC Callaway now of the Financial Times eventually Erica friend landed a grand job running a medium sized company a few weeks and I had lunch with him and he told me he was having a pretty grim time Hafiz stuff was mediocre the culture was sleepy and it wasn\u0027t a total sure his plan to change things would work last week we mass again and I\u0027ll just how it was going great he said soul good when I congratulated him on having whipped everything into shape he replied that the only thing he had so far managed to whip into shape was himself it worked out that the first thing you have to do is a chief executive it\u0027s a land to lie for a start you can never admit to not enjoying the job or even to finding it stressful instead you must insist that it\u0027s stimulating and going well and that you are entirely and control next you can never hinge the dislike or don\u0027t rate anyone you work with my chairman is an idiot is something often thought which must never be after it even less can you disparage anyone who works for you and then bad mouthing your company is out of the question you\u0027re responsible for it and for everyone who works that and you have to be chief cheerleader at all times however on natural that feels the anytime it\u0027s possible to say something negative is when you can either blame it on your predecessor or when you have a plan up your sleeve for improving masses even then though such talk can still be dangerous the final thing my friend his land is never to tell anyone that he\u0027s not show as chief executive you can\u0027t say when making this takeover but I\u0027m not entirely sure if it will pay off instead you have to present every initiative as a no brainer no serious doubts over strategy for basin but admissions of self doubts have ruled out to even though many of the best chief executives are riddled with it they must not ever say I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m up to this for fear they\u0027ll be taken at face value possibly these for forbidden tree this can be confided to a sympathetic spouse in the dead of night but that\u0027s about as far as it\u0027s wise to go it\u0027s all pretty constraining especially given how hard the job is my friend reports that the only good thing about pretending to be having a great time is that helps you convince yourself that you actually are the bad thing is it\u0027s thoroughly alienating if you can\u0027t tell your friends what you really failed then there isn\u0027t much point in having friends in the first place as I headed back to work after lunch is occurred to me that his list was not complete the father to boo and he had just broken that the fifth thing you can never say as a chief executive is my job involves lying does anyone acceptable view of what it takes to be a great leader which is that you have to be honest at all times in real life a chief executive Canadian forward to be honest up to a point and that\u0027s the scope for honesty is so curtailed that the job is quite unsuited to anyone who like my friend is too addicted to saying what they really think this is Lisa Calloway the BBC world service however very honest correspondent from the Financial Times that now had it will business report was celebrating a very special Beth they said but the details here\u0027s my colleague Richard callings nnj show was top of the pop charts back in early nineteen ninety one you may have heard a lot on the radio at the time but will you

    "text": "this is world business report from the BBC world service I\u0027m Susanna Theresa tucking agrees to stop the flow of migrants into Europe in return for more Asian visa free travel for it citizens across the EU we\u0027re only actually fear an influx appropriately with visa free travel because in Turkey also we have higher welfare we have higher growth rate dishonour sag whipping South Africa do the Guptas exec too much influence over government they have a widespread of businesses someone listed some are not but the common thread seems to be that there is a link with the south African government somewhere along the line and why keeping it local keeps the presses rolling something a little bit magical going on that was still going and we still find ways of sticking in Barcelona hoping all and it\u0027s one of Britain\u0027s major status and its print run we find out how that tiny newspaper stays in business but fast Turkish authorities have intercepted hundreds of migrants trying to reach the Greek island of Lesbos in a major operation involving ships and helicopters the drive to stop them reaching Europe\u0027s borders came as EU leaders clinched a deal with Ankara to halt illegal migration the president of the European Council Donald to six that there was unanimous agreement between Turkey and the twenty eight nation bloc we agreed that all irregular migrants coming from thirteen to Greek islands from the Sunday the twentieth of March will be returns to third the implementation to be phased in gradually based on the so called wild for awhile principle on a more general note some may think that if agreement is a silver bullet but the already small conflicts it is just one pill of the European Convention strategy fans can work only if the other bill last fall also implement when in return it\u0027s believe Turkey has won concessions on the acceleration of its bid for EU membership the doubling of refugees today seven billion dollars and visa free travel for Turkish citizens across the EU by June earlier Turkish president recipe type Adwan said his country was already bearing a much bigger share of the burden than Europe yeah virtualize consume Mucha it\u0027s a time when Turkey is hosting a three million refugees those who are unable to find space for a handful of refugees who were in the middle of Europe keep these innocents and shameful conditions must first look at themselves well the deal reached today marks a radical shift of tactics of the year in which more than a million people entered the EU by crossing the sea from Turkey to the Greek islands she denies is the secretary general of the economic development foundation a research organization specializing in European a fast paced in Istanbul I asked her how easy the agreement would be to implement I think there is a question mark there because the EU has previously agreed to accept their quota you couldn\u0027t fulfill his because several of the member states objected to accepting this again so now it would be unrealistic to expect that now the EU or the member states would agree the taken refugee so it will still be made the only countries like Germany take in more refugees but there is also a problem in Germany that the public opinion inserting a yes there is a huge situation are taking the mortgagee so I think it\u0027s quite difficult the but of course when you exchange of refugees is agreed by the two sides maybe it makes her key to more easily accepted readmission agreement one very controversial because of the stale as far as many European citizens fail is the fact that they will be visa free travel for Turkey citizens across Europe and already many fair that that could put undue pressure on that countries on their services if the borders effectively open to many more people here it has created a lot of controversy further could still Turkey has to fulfill a number of criteria you test because low there are a lot of cultural beautiful mansions that Turkey has exits approved and certified also there are some obligations like strengthening its border management system so there\u0027s a whole social criteria that Turkey has a full field I think the either deal will depend on the what impact do you think this visa globalization will have on economic relations between Turkey and the European Union I think it will have a criteria goodness sakes because now we have a customs union and they are also in the process of starting to negotiate the modernization of the customs union and it\u0027s also the name of the services sector the one you talk about services in a force prenatal month is the a very important part of it is because people are the service providers I think if you we can also attained the free moments especially for sharp from federal to hang an area I think this will bring it to her contact between Serbs and the European Union it\u0027s important to note though is nice that\u0027s they says for tourists ready it\u0027s not for as you say services people to work in the services industry isn\u0027t workin companies across Europe many European systems fail is that the free movement of people has gone too far and if that is affecting wage growth in individual countries yeah I mean this is a very important point I do not forget people to go and settled in the EU itself for short term to use to get business purposes for example for a business person to engage in a business deal test for the short term Chang MD but equally should also published a report on the impact that is likely to result from this if he\u0027s a liberalization and in the company\u0027s assessment was that there is no need to actually fear an influx of proficiency with visa free travel because in Turkey also we have higher welfare we have higher growth rate we will not see the experience the expected flu migration flow from Turkey I think in the dealer will not really has a major impact on migration well it was GM announced on the economic development foundation in Istanbul is a powerful business family in South Africa too close for comfort to the government his claim that the Guptas siblings who and interests across many industries exit so much influence over president Jacob Zuma that they even give out ministerial jobs that does have denied the accusations and in parliament the president denied that appointments have been influenced there is no minister who is here was ever appointed by the group does or by anybody else Mister president you and your family I didn itself while south Africans I get to import a lot and losing weight but south Africa\u0027s last white president activity to clock said president Zuma\u0027s actions were threatening democracy fact is this do much nepotism fact is this too much corruption fact is they still much favoritism and a black elite has grown I asked him cover an editor of south Africa\u0027s business day newspaper to tell me more about the group to family they all three brothers who came to South Africa from India about so fifteen years ago there are now seventeen citizens or they\u0027ve taken outside African citizenship but they are engine origin hello grounds all that for the claims that they exacts political power because pulse of this is due to that incident back in December when the finance ministers resigned to well replaced in quick succession this is a very disputed issue of course they deny you know being involved in any kind of cronyism in South Africa or influencing the political system in any way but there\u0027s a lot of evidence that is building the tsa refutes that and over the past week the most serious charge has you\u0027re just exploded Southwark nobody talk it all started ready with a passing comment you know a report in the Financial Times which suggested that members of the family had time off with the job of the finance minister to the deputy finance minister the deputy finance can sustain this instant the jobs and just before that incident when the finance ministers changed last year late last year the family initially dismissed the claim out of hand butts so after being signed for a long time the deputy finance minister did acknowledge that it did happen this week and as a consequence a series of other people in government have made similar claims and I understand that the former balsa south Africa\u0027s state power firm has become one of the latest figures to accuse this family of having ties with that the president yeah you know the modus operandi seems to be Morris saying the family\u0027s interest involved in doing business with these states organizations in one way or another they have a widespread of businesses that are huge they own a newspaper they own you know uranium what must we coal mine some interests in no military defense so it\u0027s a very wide ranging set of businesses summer listed from a not but that the common thread seems to be that there is a link with the south African government somewhere along the line another Cup his have rejected all of these claims saying that the victims of a plot have they given any more details about what kind of plot you know they\u0027re just saying that these are tapes to smear them that this is an attempt to restrictive business activity I mean the most obvious link is serving with the presidency one of the its name is a dishonest emojis formally a partner in almost all of the business ventures in one way or another we know that they have done business with other members of the president\u0027s family too but it is only seems to be the main partner and he is we think representing Zeba plans a whole nother body parts the ANC has said today that the relationship between Jack exam and the group does it mean has not been on the agenda as a meeting of the party\u0027s leadership today to think they\u0027re really trying to downplay with these accusations there\u0027s a huge **** within the ANC about the links between party members and business in general and to this seems to be the most egregious case and within the agency\u0027s meeting this weekend they claim books so the issue is not going to addressed specifically but there are dozens we say of NC in various capacities have expressed concern about this really right to the top so it it Kitty is something that is Sir dividing the party Tim Keown from business day you\u0027re listening to wealth is this report from the BBC world service still to come the value of business degrees in a sense the system that rewarded that kind of investment in an MBA is if not broken at least antiquated that\u0027s all coming up that time not to check in with the financial markets and a little alley I spoke to just below a from CMC markets who told me what the movie is well on the London exchange it\u0027s been that they have to hops in a way we started off a little lackluster but we had some some words from the European central bank suggesting that they may cut interest rates further so that was an interesting one that supported sentimental little bit standard chartered was the biggest rise on the day banks have been suffering a bit recently so this was a short covering I think you could say the same about sports direct which was also a big Raisa they\u0027re about to be demoted from the thirty one hundred down to defeat see two fifty seven a few people getting out of their short positions that you talked about the urban central bank indicating that interest rates might full further that benchmark race and that\u0027s quite interesting because alter the initial announcement of facts in large program of quantitative easing Mario Draghi a pitch to indicate that they wouldn\u0027t be a fan of the cot well quite exactly and I think that\u0027s what we\u0027re seeing now is the ECB are trying to address the concern that we saw in markets writes after that whereby the euro jumped in European stocks fell he\u0027s trying to say what actually nine we\u0027ve not run out of tools here that the tool box is still full we can cut interest rates further we need to and they\u0027ve also raise the idea of this helicopter money which is literally paying money to the to the public in order to spur growth a barrel of Brent crude ticked up above forty dollars a barrel today what is pushing the price upwards place to fact Israeli that the price of the U. S. dollar has been slumping after the federal reserve failed to to raise interest rates as many had suspected and obviously oil is denominated in dollars but the other big thing is that we have produces both OPEC and non OPEC producers like Russia setting up for a meeting in April where they may discuss freezing out put in obviously it\u0027s been the oversupply of oil which has been a big downwards factor on it and say the fact that supply may be cut back a bit is is supporting prices hospital of MCNC markets while in London the one hundred share index was down point two percent at sixty one ninety and in New York the Dow is up point five percent at seventeen thousand five hundred and sixty it\u0027s that time of the week now will meet back at just some of the stories of the past week nnova is former president Lula da Silva has been blocked by the courts from taking a job in his successes government or get a political crisis got an economic crisis we got what some people call a moral crisis because of corruption is a very delicate moment for pn a new global Britain and Germany agree search for what they\u0027re trying to do is trips do most of Marcus Steve Jobs mark Zuckerberg that old college dropouts now one of the business green graduate degree if you could make it to the top of the business world without one reality is is that it top program like Colombia\u0027s the opportunities that are open would not otherwise be so Brazil\u0027s former president is appointed chief of staff despite being involved in a corruption probe a mega mergers agreed between the London Stock Exchange and on each of us and MBAs business masters degrees left the cost and hauled workload to disclose issues I spoke to and the Canary senior international editor at The New York Times within Paris and Mary child\u0027s U. S. financial correspondent of the Financial Times in New York and I began by asking and if she thought the mass protests in Brazil well understandable absolutely I mean if you look at Brazil from outside of Brazil you say to yourself oh it\u0027s a it\u0027s a corruption scandal it\u0027s resource base this was inevitable so much money sloshing around the business but if you\u0027re in Brazil this is an existential cry Brazilians have been accustomed thinking of themselves or at least since about twenty ten when Lula when he was president declared that this was going to be the Brazilian century and the country was going to be on the upsurge taking its place among world powers did Brazilians believed it and there was no reason not to because well prices were rising Petrobras was the sixth biggest company in the world now it turns out that if these these probes are finding anything they\u0027re finding that this success might have been based on a massive fraud so it\u0027s not surprising that you\u0027re seeing people the streets not surprising you\u0027re seeing your reaction it\u0027s almost it\u0027s almost visceral most personal Mary child\u0027s eve been following this story it\u0027s a real full from grace\u0027s net for Brazil gates no surprise railway that these corruption allegations have have affected them deeply absolutely I think the point about the optimism and and then that being reversed that\u0027s huge I think that can\u0027t be overstated the IMF is predicting that Brazil\u0027s economy will contract by almost eight percent between January and beginning a twenty fifteen in the end of this year and I think that that\u0027s such a reversal you know from a country that that you know wanted to host the Olympics in a country that felt so much optimism just a few short years ago I think that this ten year I think it does look as though you know people are calling for her exit by the end of twenty eighteen you know before she ends her turn at the end of eighteen twenty eighteen and it\u0027s it looks as though you know she was calling in Lula as to bolster her regime and then ironically calling this scandal with the the you know the the release tapes leaks tapes revealing a conversation with her between her and Lula she\u0027s calling that an engineered cool from the elites of the country which I think may illustrate how tone deaf things have become another story we\u0027ve been following this week is the union between the London Stock Exchange and sociable switches on the cards an agreement is billed as a merger resumes but dirigibles will hold the power in this relationship going to marry yes and they also are more profitable so it\u0027s it\u0027s interesting to see that the London Stock Exchange is kind of a little bit you know they\u0027re they\u0027re very much emphasizing that this is a merger of equals that there is sort of a a slight subordination here where to your point you know that the leadership will be very much from Deutsche Borse and the London Stock Exchange it\u0027s I think that the shares rallied and and people are feeling much more optimistic for about the deal that they\u0027re getting and and it\u0027s no stepmother this deal will go ahead with it because there are others sniffing around the London Stock Exchange not least the owners of the New York Stock Exchange absolutely I think you know musical cue here you need to to get that old song sixteen candles up because it is in sixteen years at the London Stock Exchange and those rivers of been doing a little dance around each other since the year two thousand that was the first time a combination of these two was was moved at the fact that it\u0027s happening now is interesting in light of the fact that Britain is grappling with the idea of leaving the European Union the people who are promoting this the spokespeople for the two exchanges are saying all the fact that the Briton might leave the European Union that won\u0027t affect this at all but there are a lot of things that could affect of that\u0027s one of them there\u0027s also the matter of the own stock exchanges songs got public shareholders and if Deutsche Boerse is interested and other companies are like the nice the stockholders are going to want to see what other offers they can get the merger is supposed to take place be finalized in a year the first quarter of twenty seventeen there is a lot of running room in between then and now okay well another issue that we\u0027ve been looking at this week his them all about the value of degrees because Bill Gates Steve Jobs and mark Zuckerberg all a college dropout so is it worth getting a graduate business degree what do you think Mary I think in some cases it can be I\u0027ve certainly had friends whose whose jobs require them almost to go to graduate school in order to advance in their career which I think might be sort of more of a hat tip to the degree inflation we\u0027ve seen in the U. S. and elsewhere but I think to your point about Steve Jobs Mexico but there it is not necessary I think Mickey Drexel\u0027s that at the Milken conference a few years ago that anytime he gets a resume he hopes that it doesn\u0027t have business schools on it because there is kind of a risk of group think and and you go to the same classes it\u0027s produced this cadre of people who see the world in a similar way and it\u0027s not clear to me that that\u0027s necessarily a good thing because I am people stand all for most of money detonate on getting these degrees and if it doesn\u0027t encourage the entrepreneurial spark is it really adding value to a Korea well there are lots of different ways to make a lot of money than be an entrepreneur on the other hand it is true that this the fact that these degrees are so expensive I mean an undergraduate degree for years from an elite U. S. institution costs a quarter million dollars now that\u0027s a lot of money to basically learn how to learn which is what the undergraduate degree is suppose to be about business school at Lisa\u0027s pre professional so the cost benefit analysis of that tends to make sense but on the other hand no degree is an end in itself it\u0027s a means to an end once you take that have that MBA you have to apply a certain amount of hard work and initiative and then you have to have a certain amount of luck so Zuckerberg in the rest may not have had the degree but they had all the rest and that maybe in the end is the decisive factor if there are employers out there and they\u0027re certainly seem to be some who don\u0027t care whether you have a degree from a top ten business school then in a sense the system that rewarded that kind of investment in an MBA is if not broken at least antiquated and that\u0027s on bank America New York times with Larry Charles from the left one of Britain\u0027s national newspapers the independent will no longer be printed from next week it\u0027s moving completely online after losing around seven million dollars over the past year local newspapers in some parts of the UK are flourishing one such paper is the scent Ives times and echo in Cornwall the most southern southwesterly region of Britain it still produces its weekly edition on local printing presses the papers been in circulation since eighteen ninety nine I went along to meet the people who put it together dnmt printing really all known as into Tony kava check out the latest program at the City Lights times and co every week around two and a half thousand because that essays is mass production technique is Abbas changed when Tony began at the paper forty years ago when I stop as well as the newspaper we were doing posters for the local cinema we were still using wooden type setting it by hand and pulling the places by hand on the eighteen nineties compress then as now the paper was sold to newsagents across the small Cornish town which for many years has been a draw for artists with steep narrow streets and galleries on almost every corner according to Tony keeping it local is key to success willow has to do with the time in the community it\u0027s very independent it has been a very free monkey community and it has its unique position in the aisle and the newspaper is unique in the fact that it stopped him into the arts colony since the very early days also the fun we do specialize in all time the store shelves might Wilkinson helps decide what will make front page news and is a voluntary Coast Guard he can also be part of the story the whole of life so far over the terms fuel probity okay since pastry box price really have you ever come back to the office with many stories from and to say yeah we do come back and assess everything and get something put together gently appears in the newspaper so to find out just how popular it is I\u0027ve come to with inequalities entertained although I have just how popular is that sin tights times an echo if you don\u0027t follow it you miss out on a limb use of really local news that you can\u0027t get anywhere else and then you feel the Cornish Peipus it\u0027s kind of traditional and sometimes we have to buy it and we have to read it we sort of call it personalized bibles should I say because everything then that and coming back into the newsroom hair and just in front of me underneath for the main desk is this huge array of bound books dating back to nineteen eleven it\u0027s the scent eyes times it\u0027s takeout nineteen sixteen and find out what was happening officials of the national news London hit with an Iraq that and it is that a vote of the page you\u0027ve gotta unknown advert if you\u0027ve got a bullet in your home simple Simon is the soap for you all possibly have to bring in the advertising back in nineteen sixty Colin sangha used to be ad sales executive at the paper he remembers the advertising heyday the eighties and early fall analysis was the Thatcher years and I do remember then that some of those and fly shingles between fifteen eighteen percent in that period people were spending a lot of money on advertising and it was not unusual to have a newspaper anything from Eckstine papers up to about twenty four and five remember doing twenty book page newspapers another paper is half the size and instead survives on other forms of funding editor Tony comeback and the self publishing private publishing signs strangely enough it is developing side of the business so we\u0027re not as dependent as a lot of newspapers all that off just like totally dependent on advertising and don\u0027t have don\u0027t have anything else it also survives on a strong work ethic tennis father bought the paper back in nineteen fifty one and it\u0027s still a family a fat this me boy was exiled to the accounts of Monsanto really works in the businesses photojournalism book designer and graphic artist more somebody also works in the business Kim who is sort of some additional sports and the types of as much of that\u0027s about fifty percent of the stuff the paper has made it into the online world the printed edition is still very much the focus so what does the future hold on I have absolutely no idea as to the future but there is no crystal ball I mean when I was at school I wasn\u0027t expecting to be in the newspaper and I didn\u0027t expect it to be surviving I could something a little bit magical going home that was still going and we still find ways of sticking in Barcelona hoping all I and that was Tony convert the very committee is editor of the eyes times now you might like to know that we hope is a support is celebrating its twenty fifth anniversary in the next few weeks would love you to shed any members of what you were doing when the program was first broadcast first of April nineteen ninety one no jokes please from all of us here thanks for listening goodbye ",

    "text": "this is the world business report from the BBC world service I\u0027m Alex Ritson Brazil\u0027s former president Lula da Silva has been blocked by the courts from taking a job in his successes government opponents say his attempted appointment was a blatant attempt to avoid prosecution for corruption some people and some politics are saying that denomination easy strategy to protect Tallulah from being investigated or even arrested during this car wash pro it\u0027s six hundred days since the last boatload of would be migrants turned up on Australia\u0027s coastline will be asking if that means Europe should be learning lessons from the tough treatment given to refugees down unda Europe you know is a boxing some of the worst wars seen in recent history and I don\u0027t think any number of fences being built in southeastern Europe is going to prevent the large scale migration Britain\u0027s latest budget was notable for its lack of green policies campaign a se London is out of step with the rest of the world take China in the last year alone they\u0027ve added more wind power capacity in the UK has got in its entirety plus what to Bill Gates Steve Jobs and mark Zuckerberg all have in common apart from achieving great wealth and fame will have the answer for you during the next thirty minutes nndb when Linda sue who was elected president of Brazil he promised to change the lives of the pool but now he sparking street protests over allegations of involvement in corruption at the state run oil company Petrobras an attempt by his success of the current president Dilma Rousseff to make him a minister in her government that\u0027s been blocked by the courts it was widely seen as a move to protect him from prosecution because ministers Computron in any court lower than Brazil\u0027s Supreme Court where the judges are appointed by the president president Dilma and former president Lula discussed the matter in a very friendly telephone call which was secretly recorded and then released to the media by the investigating judge causing mass protests on the streets of Rio and elsewhere we\u0027ve used actors to voice up that discussion in English later I need to tell you something go ahead there right I\u0027m sending better safer with the papers say that we have them just in case they needed that the terms of office I can I don\u0027t know that\u0027s good that\u0027s good that\u0027s everything weight that he\u0027s heading either that okay I\u0027ll be here I\u0027m waiting it\u0027s like Hey that\u0027s good I but I made it okay Jacobson is from Brazil\u0027s workers party which is the party by former president Lula and president Dilma belong to us to buy the leaders critics will right to suggest he was only trying to become a government minister to avoid prosecution well perhaps rubbish because you can be prosecuted anyway he shows that Stephanie Supreme Court even if they all the locals have no have no influence on evil black metal doesn\u0027t make any difference a difference all the all the different experience they switch tribunal can judges it makes quite a difference if the lower courts contest against him surely yeah sure you and you are not all of the minister\u0027s economic be investigated and prosecuted by disagreeing chords but you must realize how that looks to the rest of the world well this is the problem here is that we are facing distribution against the party against himself against the president\u0027s weekend being absolutely a political persecution Brazil\u0027s stock market was up about ten percent a short time ago investors seemingly enjoying the damage the scandal is doing to the government Louis Covina is a reporter from Brazil\u0027s Cuban landed a TV station he told me the allegations Luna is facing a serious he was forcibly called to talk with the federal police like in the beginning of the month about some properties that supposedly we\u0027re given to him by construction companies it\u0027s a penthouse on the coast of some Polish state and arranged and interior of some Polish state well he denies these corruption allegations and say that from the opposition and the suggestion is that he is only being given this job by the current president research in order that he should have immunity from prosecution exactly some people and some politics are saying that denomination easy strategy to protect Tallulah from being investigated or even during this car wash pro this morning in Brasilia is now the chief of staff so he can only being investigated now by the Supreme Court but when he was the president he was one of the most popular presidents in the history of Brazil in at the time everything seem to be going for him is it not just possible that this is something which is being created by his political opponents that\u0027s what\u0027s a dis investigation about corruption scandals are are arguably over because like you said during the period he was president or as you grew a lot we wait out of the poverty line so it\u0027s really strange by now but that\u0027s the point that these investigations are going to see if a the way that things went during that period it might have some well illegal illegal ways you know what\u0027s the involvement of the current president analysts Lula almost created do you mind if we can say that she was the chief of staff during Lula\u0027s government but now she\u0027s facing lots of anti government protests like less to someday own mediums of people took to the streets to demonstrate against the government it was the biggest anti government protests Ligustrum Brazil lily Cavallini from Brazil\u0027s Ebola India TV station Australia is celebrating something of a milestone it\u0027s six hundred days since the last time a boatload of illegal migrants arrived on its coastline illegal migrants had been a huge problem with more than twelve hundred people dying as they tried to reach Australia by boat between two thousand and eight and twenty thirteen then the Australian government launched what it calls operations sovereign borders spin a highly controversial program which features adverts like this the Australian government has introduced the toughest border protection measures ever if you travel by boat without a visa you will not make astrology high the message is simple if you come to Australia illegally but but there is no way you will ever make astrology high journalist Steven main from Maine reporter told me the whole purpose is to make would be refugees feel unwelcome well under the previous labor government earlier fifty two thousand unauthorised arrivals apocalypse Ryan shows in this court water public disquiet and the conservative government time invested by Tony Abbott napa Malcolm Turnbull with a very tough regime which included turning back boats on the high seas and that the stood determinedly not letting anyone arrive so that\u0027s been affected because we\u0027ve now been six hundred die since the last version arrived in twenty five different parts have been turned back and discordant under people currently on the tension in the room and then asylum but it has stopped about it\u0027s even though it\u0027s been very controversial the international so this is about sending a message to people who want to come to Australia who are considering crossing the ocean it\u0027s you\u0027re not welcome here what I try to government clients that smashed the people smugglers business model and even when you deal and recently offered to take a hundred fifty refugees from the romantic sound the government rejected that because I felt it would have been an incentive for people to come because you can shop and not country like you deal so the ongoing quandary with the policies where do the people in detention finish up and the government is in negotiation with the locks of allies in the Philippines and Indonesia but the strategy is to have an unattractive country where they will finish shopping so that I don\u0027t have any incentive to get going about trying come to a stronger so it\u0027s a it\u0027s a pretty unpleasant process boss it works and what you\u0027re saying here is the end justifies the means but certainly the government\u0027s position on the local party which you know did did did have twelve hundred deaths at sea when it was in office with those fifty two thousand unauthorised arrivals I have now fall into line and I support a tax regime and I support offshore the tensions that with the bipartisan position now to be very tough and the public is satisfied with that was ongoing controversy with I many refugee advocates and that is ongoing reports about poor treatment in in the room and a solid better things like the number of children in detention which did take it almost two thousand people a little bit the labor government in that down to about sixty children engines but that\u0027s the approach that I think that\u0027s a look we just got one of hypocrisy Lawson high say they should stay where they are and I don\u0027t mean in Indonesia and other places in in in appetizer and they shouldn\u0027t Australia and that\u0027s perfect now they\u0027ve not been coming for sort of a six hundred bytes that Stephen made a journalist with Australia\u0027s main reporter putting the case for the Australian government not everyone is convinced though Danny stricken diraja campaigns for the rights of refugees for the civic a script he told me Australia\u0027s attitude is wrong on every level sadly most people familiar with international legal obligations around migration around basic human rights consider this an ultimate failure in Australia\u0027s obligations to asylum seekers and those people who are fleeing persecution and warm around the world what a study saying it hasn\u0027t allowed anyway to Australia to find refuge in that come but in the five years prior to the introduction of this policy twelve hundred people died crossing to Australia and boats and those are just the ones we know about who absolutely we need to address the regular migratory froze the desperate measures that people have to take to get to somewhere but I don\u0027t think shutting off straight into the rest of the world is the right solution I think we need to invest a lot more in policing what happens in those times reward as kind of course allowing for legal channels by which those seeking refuge can come to a place like Australia is going to be part of the solution as well but Australia says the legal channels open if people want to come by legal route they still kind what they\u0027re doing here is shutting down the illegal roots and thereby putting the people traffickers who just doing this to make a profit out of business the fundamental challenge here is that there are vast numbers of people around the world who are being displaced for all sorts of reasons and we as civilized humanity have created a set of rules norms those people you need protection are able to find protection on the site for the world but what\u0027s happened systematically in the last few decades in Australia has been at the forefront of this is that we\u0027ve started to pare down those commitments and the ability of those people seeking refuge to have any chance of finding asylum so we sort of fueling displacement through walls in places like Syria and Afghanistan and Sri Lanka but we\u0027re not creating the mechanisms by which those people can find refuge and so no wonder at that unscrupulous people smugglers can make profit out of this desperation there may be some real refugees but an awful lot of them were just economic migrants what they **** what\u0027s becoming clearer is that people who are displaced from places like Syria or Afghanistan are incredibly desperate some of them yes are persecuted many them do have economic and other motives but under international law countries like Australia are obliged to give them a fair hearing to see if they really are in need of seeking there will be people in Europe who look at the Australian experience see twelve hundred lives at least lost before this policy was introduced those lives are now being saved and say we should be doing this off the coasts of Greece I think they should be also asking how many lives are being lost by people who are stuck in parts of the world where there is war in person about a my worry about straight in exile Poland firing many European leaders isn\u0027t a stranger is a rare country that can have a chance of sealing off its borders because of its great great distance from other parts of the world it that\u0027s just not going to be possible in in Europe for example it\u0027s you know Europe is sitting you know is a boxing some of the worst wars seen in recent history and I don\u0027t think any number of fences being built in southeastern Europe is going to prevent the large scale migration that we\u0027ve seen in recent years continuing impacts even getting thicker Tony Sri scan diraja who campaigns for the rights of refugees for the civic to school you\u0027re listening to world business report from the BBC world service still to come paying for an MBA is it really worth it when costs can be up to one hundred and sixty thousand dollars effort if it\u0027s like a huge struggle and you have to save up and paid off your whole life it\u0027s kind of is a really worth it ten years ago we were being told that climate change caused by industry was going to destroy a world governments were full of ideas for new laws and taxes that would encourage people to change their behavior and save the planet the climate change seems to foreign out of fashion as a political issue Britain\u0027s finance minister delivered his latest budget yesterday unlike his counterparts in the rest of the world green measures didn\u0027t feature particularly strongly Andrew Simpson economist from the new weather institute he told me he wasn\u0027t impressed one of the big disappointments was in the area of renewable energy solar and wind power levels again hit recently by the removal of a lot of incentives there was nothing in there to bring them around that was a little bit in for offshore wind which the treasury says is new money but I think for people who are looking at the budget for its environmental credentials the thing which really would have struck them with the building on the huge tax break given to the fossil fuel companies last year for North Sea oil there a whole swathe of new and tax cuts for them to pass another tax break fat Sheldon B. P. they must\u0027ve been rather pleased with that in fact the shares went up what I think they probably were very pleased and there\u0027s a bit of a double whammy where the public purse is concerned does these new tax breaks given to them but the office for a budget responsibility also suspects predicts that the tax take from that sector is going to drop to nothing and then go effectively negative in a couple of years time so one of the sectors that the public purse relied upon quite heavily until a few years ago it is not going to be paying in and it\u0027s going to be taking out effectively isn\u0027t this the inevitable that chancellor is facing tough economic times and green measures are are not vote winners when people are trying to hang on to that jobs what if you want to kind of rebuild the economy I think the logic behind giving tax breaks to the fossil fuel centers is that it\u0027s in protection of jobs but if one\u0027s going to be said logical about that the same would apply for the renewable energy sector propounding vested you create a lot more jobs and it\u0027s very clear if you look at the international picture these are the future and the D. industries you talk about the global picture but ten years ago budgets all over the world were full of green measures now budgets all over the world are not full of great measures that there is a trend that was in that area it\u0027s it\u0027s it\u0027s because the economy of the world is in trouble taker of a big part of the global economy rising part the globe economy like China where they\u0027ve been inviting it will kinds of problems but in the last year alone they\u0027ve added more wind power capacity in the UK has got in its entirety you look at the U. S. they\u0027re adding huge amounts of new win palace actually all around the world these industries all growing and if you look at the international labor organization where the so called green collar jobs are being created are being created took very great degree so I would say that that would be the future at all they being creative with government money sunny but China\u0027s concern but it\u0027s very hard to kind of draw the line between what is going to public and private in China obviously but there\u0027s a massive governmental push that and you look in other emerging economies like India you got some of them as a rapidly developing micro medium scale renewable technologies which very often helping people where they have the least access to electricity there will be people listening to this who think the real reason finance ministers around the world aren\u0027t putting so many green measures in that budgets now is because actually climate change if it was going to be a problem it would\u0027ve happened by now it is happening now and that\u0027s part of the problem if you look at the fingerprint in a lot of the extreme weather events that happened over the last year increasingly it\u0027s impossible to say that the human fingerprint is is not that of course we now in the immediate aftermath of the Paris deal on climate change where you had an unprecedented consensus from government and from business about not just the fact that this was real it required urgent action but also that we should be being much more ambitious but the kind of targets we\u0027re setting ourselves to keep the temperature below a certain level above preindustrial levels so if you want to look at the one big area where the global economy is United and especially in terms of delivering for people at the bottom of the income part protecting them from the worst effects of climate change and creating economic opportunities the green economy is the one for the next generation Andrew Sims from the new whether institute let\u0027s take a look at what\u0027s been happening on the financial markets now a few moments ago in New York the Dow Jones indexes up point seven percent at seventeen thousand four hundred and forty six here in London they one hundred share index closed the day up point four percent at sixty two and one I\u0027m joined in the studio by Ross mold who is in mint director at AJ felt like squats been driving the opposite sentiment I think it is really that the fact that the federal U. S. federal reserve America central bank took a much more dovish much gentler line inflation than people were expecting last night in December steel people to expect full interest rate increases this year now is talking about too even though it\u0027s preferred inflation make it what he calls core inflation as exceeded the target said he would look at when it came to future interest rates and interest rate moves but perversely they that the shares are going up but that the fed is essentially saying that the outlook for the global economy is is quite gloomy are bad news is good news self as far as shares a concern because it means that interest rates will stay low for longer which means if the returns on cash are poor investors may be false look other asset classes like jazz for example for a better return on their money some interesting individual stories on the foot CTI to of the executives of the top one hundred firms stepping down Sir Andrew Wittig GlaxoSmithKline some Walsh at Rio Tinto\u0027s that\u0027s something in the air what without actually nine foot two hundred companies talk about changing their boss this you already the average of the last decade is around twelve signal thing too unusual in that respect Walsh\u0027s army inherited a very difficult and it real tenso paying down debt restructuring the business during a big commodity price downturn Mister which SR under which he at Glaxo I think the interesting thing here is when he steps down next year will look completely broken up some of the shareholders say that a full very large companies in there they\u0027ll be better off separate surround was said not on his watch so let\u0027s see what happens when he steps down am looking elsewhere mining shares have been soaring today any particular reason again unless inflation trade we talked about earlier you thought she seemed base metals go up you see the oil price go up today that\u0027s help total explorers because of talk about packets hostile make on the seventeenth of April again looking at production freezes bridge the increasing copper prices zinc nickel base metals investors are looking at potential inflation threads the fed is gonna be softer inflation he will be looking to protect themselves by buying historic hedges against that which includes things like minus and as the bank of England going to be inspired in its interest rate setting policy doesn\u0027t doesn\u0027t seem to be no he voted today nine zero to leave interest rates at the record low at half percent for the eighty four consecutive months arm and I think at the moment the market is pricing in the first bank of England rate rise sometime in twenty seventeen Russ mold investment director at AJ bell thank you for coming into the studio today a few other numbers gold trading at one thousand two hundred and sixty three dollars an ounce on the currency markets a year I will buy you one dollar thirteen point to you a sense and the pound is trading at one dollar forty four point Bill Gates Steve Jobs mark Zuckerberg what do they all have in common that all college dropouts so why bother with a business degree let alone a graduate business degree if you can make it to the top of the business world without one from New York the BBC\u0027s Michelle flurry reports on the value of an MBA any property real ones you have to forgive professor stands before an auditorium of his students animated he discussing the ins and outs of pharmaceutical pricing because time here at Columbia business school one of America\u0027s top graduate business programs doesn\u0027t come cheap a masters of business administration or MBA at this Ivy League university set you back a hundred thirty thousand dollars a figure that doesn\u0027t include expenses like books and cost of living so is it worth it it is a risk and it does take I think a a level of risk tolerance for anyone who is considering an MBA ants Michael Malone and associate dean at the school despite the risk he says investing this much isn\u0027t he well worth taking the reality is is that it a top program like Columbia\u0027s the opportunities that are opened would not otherwise be there and so I believe firmly that this is one of the things that a top MBA program can add in terms of value is opening those doors that would otherwise be opened it\u0027s nnat and dnmt many MBA students a new award by the prospect of a handsome paycheck soon after graduating nasty the median starting salary for recent NBA Gratz was said to be a hundred thousand dollars to get a sense of what value people place on an NBA spoke with with that one depends what you want for depends a filter and I think many people can get around it actually people in your generation it really does depend if you have a job and you\u0027re going to get a lot of money in this job saliva I suppose I mean I think and Stephanie good investment but I think it\u0027s a bit ridiculous the person in this country because we\u0027re from England and it\u0027s so much cheaper though and I think I wonder if if it\u0027s like a huge struggle and you have to say well paid off your whole life it\u0027s kind of is it really worth it depending on where yes I think that\u0027s fine depending on where it is so if it\u0027s a good school is worth the investment of course but critics say getting an MBA is unnecessary and that many business school curriculums frankly outdated the value of the graduate business degree also depends on where the degree is from on the schools rank taking on major debt from an MBA program that isn\u0027t from a highly regarded top to school well that\u0027s not seen as a safe bet and then there\u0027s this question can leadership even be taught in a classroom so the original was actually the spicy garlic that\u0027s actually mom\u0027s recipe meat entrepreneur an MBA student can win co founder of Siouxsie source a startup that makes not control marinades and dressings we\u0027re spicy garlic fresh lemon sweet ginger and ginger glazed so he hopes his degree will give him and his company a leg up he thinks that the entrepreneurs learning by doing is more important than time in class I\u0027ve been through the trenches you know having started from actually nothing creating something and you know hopefully going it was further it\u0027s you have to kind of have that mentality straight away and then be able to give you that surely believe tools but won\u0027t make you know Ken recently put his studies on hold to focus on his startup ask for his MBA he still wants to finish it eventually but if not he would be the first company leaders to put his business before his education shell furry with that report from New York some interesting stories on our PVC business website one just break now EU leaders trying to finalize a deal with Turkey on the migrant crisis of one of the difficulties they face at the start of a summit in Brussels German chancellor

action to achieve a ten billion we are so we don\u0027t pay later we put the next generation plus he revealed that Britain will become the latest country to tax sugary soft drinks to help tackle childhood obesity the money raced around seven hundred million dollars a year will be spent funding sports in schools the budget also gave the green light to new rail link between the northern English city of Manchester and Leeds no Sir another new rail line crossing London but John what all he speaks on finance for the opposition labor party wasn\u0027t impressed budget based on fire economic growth down business investment down trade him down wages slowing down and he\u0027s missed targets all over again rezone fiscal rule he\u0027s he\u0027s missed on debt is missed on deficit as well because remember he was suppose to what the deficit launched you and this idea he\u0027s going to make a surplus it looks as though he\u0027s been using creative accountancy to actually make that surface the main tax on British companies is to full more sharply than previously announced to seventeen percent within four years basis while Griffith has been getting reaction from one manufacturer in South Wales yes I\u0027m here in a small factory in but reports west Wales glorious sunshine outside right on the coast but here in the fabrications workshop I\u0027m joined by the managing director of I\u0027m Connie Owen Davis family firm been here forty years ago about thirty employees this is meant to be a budget for small business to do it for you yes I think it did twist I we had a bit more than I was expecting if I\u0027m being honest and all in all a fairly positive budget we see this team here working around you make sound proofing unconscious so I guess your customers right across the board has business been recent yes our products get shipped all over the world they get used in mining quarrying and all sorts of industrial applications I think that it\u0027s fair to say that last year was an orphanage here but this say here it is there at forecasting to global bet wed to an okay I think it\u0027s fair to say so what was in the budget that might help you next year a reduction in cooperation talks is a big thing going from twenty seventy percent which is nice to have obvious if you will have the staying as it is because we got vehicles equipment down the motorways whether something she would have liked to have heard today from George Osborne that would think yes I think I was hoping to get more support for apprentices for example review to the apprentice live in the past doesn\u0027t affect us because we don\u0027t imply two hundred fifty people backed up some of the levees are they putting on a large corporations they could have shed down to the SME sector and given us additional support and another thing I was disappointed not to seeing no support for the title of Gordon a new industry for windows which would be the world\u0027s first indeed I think an opportunity lost to be able to support that sector for us as a manufacturer to be huge opportunities to develop new technology in that part of the world that\u0027s canoes natural resources to generate power so for you is a pretty small company in this rural part of west Wales but trying to export globally one of the big challenges ahead our confidence I think is a big challenge getting enough confidence if week if this continual talk of depression and lack of growth that would be a big challenge we\u0027re trying to come to knock that but what the chancellor has done in previous budget is given us confidence to invest with cement investment relief in the past and obviously with what he\u0027s done today\u0027s given us some support so cash flow will ease over the next year so I wind Davis managing director of and Connie speaking to her well Griffith in South Wales the British budget also move to lower taxes paid by smaller companies on their business premises known as rates might cherry is policy director at the federation of small businesses he believes that his members will be pleased with what I heard we very much welcome some of the detailed announcements around some of the tax the small businesses have been suffering from one of the biggest things FSB was saying when we have the election last year was first and foremost businesses needed to have proper long term consistent supporter secondly they needed to see the cost of doing business actually being reduced by government and I think when you take all of that into account while the chancellor has clearly done is to listen and to understand what those concerns are if you happen to be a company that makes sugary drinks or are involved with the selling of sugary drinks he may be less less please what about this mayor to impose attacks on those kinds of drinks South Africa Nelson excimer a couple weeks back Mexico\u0027s already done it I\u0027m certainly not pretending to be in that sector or indeed have any knowledge of the silence around but I think listening to what chancellor has said it is not going to come in until twenty eighteen nights a couple years time it clearly I he said hopes to be able to give businesses the chance to modify what ever ingredients they do put into those drinks from what I everybody\u0027s saying the health issues around this is not helping our young people and I think coming on so that some of the announcements that we\u0027re now seeing around supporting young people listening to what businesses need around education and skills are welcome steps on the long journey that we need to be making to give consistent good education a good training and good apprenticeship to our young people is absolutely critical for the UK in the future Georgios from the finance minister underlined again today that growth in British productivity is weak why is that do you think is not a problem with the global economy or is that a problem with the British economy if you look at the statistics they say that the Japanese economy is far less productive than not the global economy in particular are European competitors and particularly in relation to North America for instance when you are small businesses about their productivity they would ritual that actually they\u0027re doing everything they possibly can but I think also if small businesses are to increase their productivity they need the right economic environment in which to be able to invest they need to be able to have the money but to be able to afford to pay higher wages to their employees a and also the government has to of course accept some responsibility itself around infrastructure broadband under around to some of the other areas the deities responsible for ninety today we have seen the announcements on some of the major infrastructure projects that we need desperately in the north of England and elsewhere so we have got a church three announced we\u0027ve got road improvements announced what we will be calling on the government now is to make sure that those announcements rush he delivered on the ground my charity federation small businesses here in the UK so does George Osborne\u0027s latest budget Harold brighter times ahead for prison I was one of our regular commentators the economist Roger Bootle even reality the economy\u0027s going to do what he\u0027s going to do anyways pretty much out of his hands he\u0027s separately trying to I think become more popular trying to win a few votes and pretend that if the economy does well it\u0027s down to have medical since does badly then it\u0027s down to the international economy suggesting that and and and plenty of governments got budget problems moment for one reason or another the tumbling oil price etcetera etcetera etcetera how do you assess the difficulties that the UK government is in at the moment in terms of deficit for example of the UK is faced a pretty big issue over government bargain she\u0027s difficult as this into perspective because is big the deficit got to very high levels over ten percent of GDP at peak the ratio government debt Judy pay rose very substantially got above eighteen but you know the other extreme if you go to avoid you go have a bonus went in Britain\u0027s history it\u0027s twice had a debt to GDP ratio of over two hundred and forty percent I think the long term average for brightness and I\u0027ve got a theory of not so one shouldn\u0027t panic against that backdrop but the chancellor\u0027s task is being has to really try to get the deficit down to get to the point where the debt ratio peak too good full but without clobbering the economy so far I think he\u0027s done a reasonably good job but the deficit is still quite high in the debt ratio still rising he said to be a surplus in facts in the government budget in the year twenty twenty coincidently a general election year deeply thought I think it\u0027s possible because he\u0027s already five years late because he said the same thing in the last government by the end of the last parliament that be a budget deficit will be eliminated so is already behind the shed you are I think that\u0027s a fair chance of it but frankly it does all depend upon the economy what about this accelerated move to cut set the headline writer company taxes here in Britain it\u0027s going down eventually to seventeen percent by twenty twenty that compares with forty percent in the last thirty percent in Germany thirty three in France it is that the kind of move going easy if you like on business that would help a country\u0027s economy I think the chances probably doing the right thing with corporation tax of it\u0027s not clear to me that she going easy on business because they\u0027re quite a few areas in which is cutting back on the ability of companies to relieve the corporation tax burden Akashi trying to reject the system in order to minimize the chances of these large internationally mobile a company is not paying very much tax on the domestic operations corporation tax is really pretty daft tax to makes quite a sense to be moving in the direction of a lower rate of corporation tax but I\u0027m quite sure that Mr Osborne\u0027s mind is the idea that put abolition two once the attractive prospect is if you can get that rate down they more more international companies might choose to locate will have their operations in Britain any thoughts on this sugar tax which is catching quite a few headlines here in the UK the south African government announced one during its latest budget a few weeks back and Mexico has it Sir an eye catching move I think it is quite nice because she moved move and it shows the conservative government adopting measures that you wouldn\u0027t normally associate actually with the conservatives that\u0027s to say thinking in terms of society overruled lights itself and benefits to the detriment of individual choice that\u0027s fully justifiable I think but turned the traditional conservative you would have paid well if people want to as it will kill themselves by eating too much sugar then that\u0027s their business this is another example of Mr old school I think moving very much towards the center which Beatle managing director of Catholic comics here in London who has been a mixed reaction to the British budgets on the London share market Chris speech emits IT markets joins me with the latest Chris let\u0027s go through the winners and losers in terms of shared values loses first predictably perhaps assert the prospect of the sugar tax isn\u0027t going down very well with investors yes a cheap on Britvic both key sugar producers or strict produces all of the stock market suffocation optically because of its are often gruesome was an iconic approach if you like right and what about the witness which company share prices rose in reaction to the UK budget quite a few actually are the oil attacks movement the beeping showed very well the softly we also had good pace the wealth manages an insurance firms like even generals this place because that use of boost nice element and also helps build as many because of what he didn\u0027t say he didn\u0027t and making major changes to the housing market bites letters we\u0027ve seen before so that\u0027s why we had a good move from that sector to and as possibly summers to encourage building of new homes owner of our own land which is already being used cool brownfield land exactly cutting just a fair housing market to get moving and provides hope it was he continued demand for seat the hospital isn\u0027t what they provide alright let\u0027s move across the Atlantic now and many market eyes are on the US central bank the federal reserve making announcements in about what\u0027s a fifteen minutes time wise that was going at what\u0027s gonna happen well enough if it\u0027s making changes in interest rates was almost certainly won\u0027t move tool but they may provide more commission whether they\u0027ll continue to look to increase rates may be in June Anne December\u0027s was a market just awaiting their view of the US economy is strong enough and do they think they can aim to push on with this tightening cycle which means that that slow gradual raising interest rates yeah and that the the signs about the health of the US economy things at retail size Hemming grace have Tydeus economies hottie guy like a train no but it\u0027s it\u0027s getting out of the station if you like wages going up slowly but not quite the right we\u0027d like Sir Jennylyn can be optimistic but she doesn\u0027t want to get too carried away without Chris thanks very much indeed as evidence crispy commits RG markets while the main share index here in London after all of that ended up no point six percent at six thousand one hundred and seventy five the Dow there is down at the moment about a fifth of a percent of seventeen thousand two hundred and fourteen currencies the euro as foreign backbeats against the US dollars one dollar ten point seven sense and the pounds twenty one dollar forty point nine that\u0027s a full for the pound about point six of a cent well the London Stock Exchange itself is also making headlines today that\u0027s because it\u0027s a great analogy with the main German share market Deutsche Boerse sent a new chapter in the colorful history of the stock exchange here in London which dates back almost three and a half centuries our portrait rams and commodity has been tracing some of that history and finding out what the much might mean for the city of London publicans are cold hail is a ride in the financial district of the I\u0027d be is a very modern skyscraper the cheese grater around the corner is the back of it live and I\u0027m walking to change and eight which is where Jonathan\u0027s because house used to be a and I was taught to match you great he\u0027s the author of books and wanted to travel quite three toy Matthews is a rather drab looking anyway occult believe this was the start of the love the stock exchange well don\u0027t be fooled by appearances the cease to be a hullabaloo of trade you had all sorts of high class outlets in here and you had three very famous coffee houses Lloyd\u0027s doorways and possibly the most famous of the moon Jonathan\u0027s coffeehouse which were standing outside now you would have seen as much as spilling out into the alley ways sealing deals you would\u0027ve seen tradesman in the flame down swishing around you would\u0027ve seen people selling why even coffee just outside alleyways in here even found a brick building which said open ground about sixty eight C. he would\u0027ve walks in engulfed in a whirlwind of smoke and sweat and Steven and then you have sat down with your stock purchase and sets down the latest security crisis how did you all break up or they were killed off mainly by three things firstly tea iced tea arrived in the same country in the sixteen fifties but it was much more expensive because I had to be imported from further afield from China and was a high import cheesy but it\u0027s a lot of the jokes in the seventeen fifties this time the being lifted and it\u0027s becoming much more affordable secondly technological inventions like the telegraph I\u0027m here in the in the early nineteen she you can transmit messages between sounds even but if oceans that renders obsolete the traditional coffeehouse cry of what niece of the unfriendly this evolution this trends towards evolution into private members clubs several top two pats lost a square which is in the heart of the city across Americans he supports cathedral which is pretty much the oldest building in the vicinity because everything around me is very large and very new and very clean that\u0027s not a square is also the home of the London Stock Exchange that is no coffeehouse inside and there\u0027s no trading floor if I want to go and see a trifle I have to go to one of the nearest investment banks or brokerage houses so now in a trading floor in the hall to the city it\u0027s a brokerage firm Samuel Gordon is got a hundred fifty year history I\u0027m in front of him basically in a room the size of a small football pitch hundred people sitting in front of about four five screens in nature of lots of cut across and charts so I\u0027m here with a veteran of the city I would say David Buchanan sake of you being heaven what\u0027s changed most embarrassed teddy runs of fifty three years and I\u0027ve enjoyed every single but infertile and I\u0027ve seen probably more changes than anybody else imaginable unholy top of the list is the way the stock exchange businesses been transacted all the stock brokers and insisted on nd the river four hundred and that of course is changed completely and everything is green things trade this deal between the love the stock exchanges torture is could be worth around thirty billion dollars that sounds absolutely massive what exactly are they going to achieve by doing this measure what they\u0027re trying to do is sex and endorse the fact that my personal global by doing a deal like this is a total acceptance that you have to be competitive and commercially and those cost savings are huge the company\u0027s estimate they could save up to Hoffa billion dollars by doing this merger but they\u0027ve got quite a few hurdles to get over fast not only with the regulators but also persuading their shareholders that this is a good deal runs on Kamali reporting on all change in the world affixed now corruption has long been one of the biggest challenges for Nigeria home to Africa\u0027s largest economy last month the government removed almost twenty four thousand workers from its payroll after checks revealed that they didn\u0027t actually exist it\u0027s a phenomenon known as ghost workers now authorities in the northeastern state of balance she have discovered a whole new variety of ghost worker each year olds children being paid the salaries shes Dixie\u0027s a delight cara Abaqa in the capsule Abuja tell me more the boat you state government set up a committee to or did its work force that is to find out how many employees it has on his payroll and other end of the exercise discovered that thousands of people where ghost workers there where non existent in fact it was a shock to to find out that it\u0027s been NTL older children\u0027s names were found on the payroll **** teaches and there are huge sums of money were being paid to these are non existent workers the government said it realized about one point three billion naira through this exercise gosh that\u0027s very interesting and the government of course been trying to crack down all of this because government finances around a real strain with the falling oil price I suppose the question I have is what\u0027s to stop it happening again if the the people who are corrupt don\u0027t being waged outside thrown in jail find at central is plenty serious problem and it doesn\u0027t seem as if there is that political will to a deal with the issue because you know politicians there would always go back to the people for their support for their patronage and they feel that the only way the card what them or rather to the only way they can say thank you to give them money and generally politics here is all about money people don\u0027t think in terms of ideology in terms of what a politician has to offer militant in terms of what a politician offers them at that very moment that he wants they\u0027ll vote and so most of the politicians will go give money deal would give them food stuff you know majors of rice to cook and they get their vote so I it is quite a difficult thing to put a stop to Mosul budget also involves government officials perhaps it would even if it can be stopped it will take some years before now salaries were being paid by cash but because things have changed to make it faster and more transparent the government insisted that all employees must have bank accounts they must open bank accounts are through which their salaries will be paid and that even made it easier for these finance officials to include these fictitious names and then descended names too varios two shows bank account and then claim the money after like cara Abaqa speaking to me from a pitcher what is your idea of a perfect holiday lounging on a beach in the summer perhaps or maybe a spot of cultural cramming in the world speak cece\u0027s chilly though has decided that it wants to be a world leader in a different sort of tourism altogether strider tourism Chile apparently has some of the best conditions in the world for stargazing and as a starry eyed reported Jane chambers is being at discovering at the Thomas Elke hotel in northern Chile dnmt Thomas as key that\u0027s how fast a tourism in karaoke right you can see pretty amazing stars the great conditions it\u0027s got lots of little white dozens and you can actually go up stairs lie on your bed open the flap not kind to the stars but if you want to see them with a bit more clarity you can conduct tool and look for a very powerful back telescope I don\u0027t think wrongfully astronomy tour of if you don\u0027t support you\u0027re moving this telescope from position telling them with the style yeah no we are looking Beetlejuice is a red giant the Jews will be the next local star in collapse if this is the explosive today we will see the explosion intro six hundred and forty three years more and how can you tell that at such an old style cool basically renderer older and cooler bluer younger hotter six hours down south in the capital of Santiago I\u0027m off to me popular Alvarez who\u0027s head of our street tourism chili he\u0027s just finished a project looking at how his country can become the world leader in this field you focus on optical astronomy at this moment Chile has forty percent of the most advanced infrastructure installed worldwide and the estimates is that with the big projects that are being built now that few will rise up to seventy in the next decade and why Chitty is a mixture of different conditions but its atmospheric conditions climate conditions even some political conditions and you need to have some minimum of political stability and so want to make a huge investment in scientific equipment tells to become the world leader in astro tourism Julius competing with places like the United States the Canary Islands and the United Kingdom in the next ten years published goal is to attract two million visitors per year in order to be able to do that he once said to be more visits available to the many scientific observer trees in the north of Chile which run by mix of states and foreign investors Wilhelm neither simple sequencing not the moment Tyrion Taurus make up seventy percent of the visitors are domiciled Claudia Leon is ready for the rest of the world last year foreign tourists until my forty percent glad you speak Spanish German and English and his business learning Chinese most of the people from from other countries usually come from retain Germany Holland and the last years has come many people from feast many Chinese people I am learning Chinese to so I\u0027m here with one of the tourists he\u0027s on that tour with us Miami\u0027s inaudible came from Santiago to try to see the stars supposed to be to get the thing who are we and in this planet I think that we must try to learn everything all that report from Jane chambers in northern Chile business messages back later hold out of business news and comments Roger hearing will be with you for that\u0027s at one o\u0027clock GMT but for me Mike Johnson that\u0027s all for this world business report for more from the world of finance try business

    "text": "this is world business report from the BBC world service hello I\u0027m Mike Jones the head of the central bank in Bangladesh quits in the wake of one of the biggest bank rates in history to protect the image of the of the bank I resigned voluntarily attitude big event much higher moral ground as Germany moves to abandon nuclear power the country\u0027s energy giants sue for damages the utility companies say that the decision to close down you clear has hit the profits hard it\u0027s white value of shareholder wealth and that the decision was illegal rise and spectacular full of Nokia we have a special report from the country of its birth no he was huge in Finland by all indicators it was the arm back bono everything here now we have horrendous unemployment situation what will a new global crackdown on the trade in endangered species due to help save the rhino and will be hearing about a new twist in the long running battle for compensation by American football players who believe their sports damage their health it was one of the world\u0027s biggest bank jobs last month unknown side to hack is still more than a hundred million dollars of Bangladeshis foreign currency reserves stored in an account at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York now the head of the Bangladesh central bank at your Rahman has resigned after meeting the country\u0027s prime minister in an interview with the BBC Mr Rahman said he was taking responsibility for what happened I thought you protected the image of the of the bank you know I yeah resigned voluntarily attitude big Arab right it much higher moral ground not many examples out there in the country you know to really take that responsibility morally and then resigned Olsen told banks and the banks should be very careful about the cyber attack this is you know a terrorist act its belief that cyber thieves used computer malware or malicious software to steal authorization codes and transfer a hundred and one million dollars from the Bangladeshi central banks in New York accounts to Sri Lanka and the Philippines that the theft happened in early February it only came to light last week government officials said they were angry that they hadn\u0027t been told earlier it\u0027s about us is South Asia bureau chief for the Financial Times newspaper in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka we think it could be one of the biggest bank robberies ever even the great train robbery in the UK in today\u0027s money did not reap as much reward for the thieves as this house of and it\u0027s it\u0027s really a very important warning sign for warning bell for banks around the world whether the central banks of commercial banks and indeed for for large corporations because it shows that money can be transferred from their accounts without the knowledge now it\u0027s true that we don\u0027t know yet whether there was some insider on the bank that help the process but is no evidence of that yet and it\u0027s possible that this was an entirely external attack are using software using malware and that there was no inside operator helping to authenticate the codes for the money transfers but obviously this money was deposited at the U. S. central bank the U. S. federal reserve I note the time the question marks I would who is happy to blame for lax security you might think that the finger of blame would point at the Americans rather than the Bangladeshis that\u0027s right now the Bangladeshis did initially say that they thought the fed was partly to blame for not insuring that was full authentication of these transfers the fed has responded voted systems were not in any way compromised and it simply followed normal procedure using the swift electronic transfer system and that therefore it\u0027s it\u0027s it\u0027s nothing to do with them though I don\u0027t think it\u0027s any doubt that the money was transferred from the Bangladesh count in New York at the federal reserve and how much do we know now about how this attack actually happened and and where on earth the money has gone too well how the heck happened with still not sure about it seems to have been a piece of a malicious software that possibly clone the authentication codes and that for our need the transfers but the the place where most of them went the ones that got through was the Philippines and and they were apparently for accounts with a result commercial banking corporation in Manila and then the money somehow find its way some of it to to casino groups and thirty million dollars seems to being handed over in cash to a man in Manila this is according to the Philippines anti money laundering council and was in fact a hearing today of the Philippine Senate about this whole issue because obviously the Philippines is now under a lot of pressure to tighten up its money laundering legislation or rather it\u0027s actually money laundering implementation of of those those that was victim us if the Financial Times in Dacca now the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster in Japan five years ago sent shockwaves around the world in the aftermath countries rush to review their nuclear programs you didn\u0027t shoot divisiveness and step by step we will abandon nuclear energy by the end of twenty twenty two spouse is a big challenge for Germany but it also means huge opportunities for future generations we believe that our country can become a frontrunner for the creation of renewable energy gone in again via concurrence the German government led by Anglo mackel made a landmark decision in the aftermath of Fukushima to close down all its nuclear power plants it was a decision though which angered the big four utility companies in Germany which include element RWE they are now suing the government for damages worth almost twenty eight billion dollars jammies constitutional courts the country\u0027s highest has begun a two day hearing on the case the BBC\u0027s Damian McGinnis in Berlin told me more the utility companies say that they have plans and vested according to this earlier agreements and that the decision to close down you clear has hit their profits hard it\u0027s white value of shareholder wealth in the utility companies say it\u0027s really a clear case of property rights and the rule of law are effectively and that the decision was illegal government on the other hand says that this was a legal decision and that it not only met all the legal requirements but the environment minister has said earlier today in court that it was the right decision said the government feels it has the moral high ground and argues that the shutdown was necessary after Fukushima because the risks have changed so much in Japan as a result of the meltdown that this was necessary to do in Germany to stop any risk of something similar happening happening here okay so these companies are not trying to reverse the government\u0027s decision to shut down all nuclear power plants by twenty twenty two they\u0027re simply trying to claim some money for the losses they say they would incur as a result yes absolutely Mike and I think that\u0027s an important clarification you\u0027re quite right it\u0027s not about continuing nuclear power and certainly after the sudden decision in two thousand and eleven by the government there\u0027s there\u0027s no chance that any company in Germany would not once we\u0027ve been investing you clear because even if they were able to after twenty twenty two it\u0027s very unlikely that any utility company would have enough faith to invest in you clear what it really is about is getting money for this sudden decision which they feel really took away their property rights and is against the rule of law and you mentioned that it was a popular decision the government\u0027s decision to change course on nuclear is that still the case does the public the general public still back the government in in a case like this do you think that yes I think it\u0027s fair to say that nuclear power here was always controversial and now since Fukushima it\u0027s also been very unpopular Anglo MacColl\u0027s decision was extremely popular issues even accuse of being quite populist in taking this decision because she was really following the public support public opinion and I also has to be said the big utility companies there are not that popular there often accused of hiking prices and not passing on low fuel costs to customers so I think we can safely say the government probably has the popular opinion on his side but the question here is whether it was legal because we\u0027re talking here about the highest courts in Germany the Constitutional Court and so they wouldn\u0027t be looking a popular opinion they will be looking at so what happens next two day hearing then what\u0027s that mean yeah that\u0027s rice is the Tuesday hearing we\u0027re going to have both sides over the next few days and the decision is expected to take a couple of months at least both sides say they are confident of winning the case I am the utility firm says a clear cut case of property rights of rule of law the government says this was a legal decision am but I think this really has ramifications they because what is not only about the tens of billions of dollars that this could cost the government if the government lost it\u0027s also about further compensation as a result of this shutdown a nuclear powered by twenty twenty cities if if the government loses this this could just be the start of a whole range of other lawsuits I was timing McGinnis in Berlin you listen to world business report from the BBC world service still to come on the program just how dangerous is American footbal we do need to have an ethical discussion about at what age did you start exposing a child to the possibility of this disease that will rock their brain for the rest of their life so let\u0027s catch up with the latest from the financial markets Jasper Lola from CMC markets joins me live Jasper a Canadian pharmaceuticals companies making the headlines what\u0027s the company and wise in the spotlight good evening my guess is valiant pharmaceuticals and so investors have really been taken to the cleaners on this one this stock is actually down forty seven percent just today as as far back as August was trading at two hundred sixty dollars now trading at forty dollars on the justification for today is that it\u0027s it\u0027s a revised pounds in its earnings estimates of it Mr estimates in its previous quarter but the greatest story here is that Sir the company\u0027s facing some serious problems Hillary Clinton of all people actually specifically reference the company saying she would go after them in one of her campaign ads this because he described what they\u0027ve been doing is predatory pricing so basically they\u0027re a pharmaceutical company they sell drugs what they\u0027ve been doing is taking advantage of that position and selling these drugs are really elevated prices something that most people can\u0027t afford and it\u0027s really bring up costs across the whole US healthcare system it\u0027s a real hot political issue at the moment but not only that they\u0027ve actually been been investigated by the SEC which is the regulator over in the U. S. for doing some sort of accounting trickery with one of their distributors inflating sales are a lot of problems with the company it is being reflected in the surprise I unless they in the United States retail sales are in the spotlight to face today that was the big data points today absolutely obviously with wit taking every data point in mind head of the federal reserve meeting tomorrow where they could raise interest rates and the retail sales declined point one percent in February inside that was actually in line with expectations did the bigger issue is that actually the numbers for January I got revised much lower than was previously expected inside the big worry here is the violent US consumers going out and spending with this cuts from gasoline prices that we should all be benefiting from its its just raising a little bit of concern as to where that strength is from the US consumer when the economy appears to be growing attack just thank you for not shooting fast just below a joining us live from CMC markets in the city of London with the main share index here in London finished the day down no point six percent six thousand one hundred forty the Dow was so low on Wall Street is down about a fifth of a percent seventeen thousand two hundred currencies viewers at one dollar eleven point one U. S. sense the pounds trading at one dollar forty one point six now if I asked you to name a famous company from Finland I\u0027ll bet that Nokia would be the name that most readily springs to mind is probably the only name I just ten years ago Nokia was the world\u0027s biggest name in mobile phones helping Finland punch way above its weight on the global economic stage with the rise of smartphones the company struggled two years ago Nokia abandoned the phone market completely Edwin lane has been to Finland\u0027s to find out where it went wrong for Nokia and what impact it\u0027s demise has had on the economy I\u0027m walking through the snow in the center of a small finish town that\u0027s looks at first glance typical of many others around this part of the world pays some squat grey blocks of flats huddled in the snow and as a strip of shops supermarkets couple of restaurants but this is a place with a very famous name Nokia it\u0027s about two hours north of the Finnish capital Helsinki and this is the town that gave its name to Finland\u0027s most sick cesspool international brand Nokia mobile phones a company that revolutionized the mobile phone industry and help propel Finland\u0027s economy some come one of the most prosperous in the world dnmt for me personally I think a one of the high points was when we actually have to Frank the mobile phones small of a multilateral and that was around nineteen ninety seven nineteen ninety eight serves the people at the heart of the Nokia story with Sepahan tia Anita grinned stram both senior managers that not his main mobile phone research and development sites in Tampa just down the road from Nokia back then the brief was simple make the phone with the best battery life the biggest screen but make it smaller than anyone else cooler able to and I\u0027ll try to learn and make mistakes and learn as a team people knew that that there were kind special skills that damn are appreciated and music continues when things started to go wrong for Nokia were you aware of that happening well I was in that one meeting there it was that you did that day and demonstrate the iPhone before day lost at this was an advert for the for the iPhone the sort you cheap in a in a in a quite a high level meeting in Nokia this hundred and fifty people managers really yes you can do that in NBC but are they able to do that infonet and can they do that really every once in awhile a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything is a revolutionary dnmt when Steve Jobs unveiled apples only phone in two thousand and seven the smartphone market so cough a Nokia struggle to keep up just seven years later gnocchi would be taken over by Microsoft and Nokia phones would disappear altogether Benwood is a mobile phone industry analyst at CCS insights it happened much faster than anyone had predicted and it was because they were completely wrong footed by the new technology apple arrived apps arrived funds became computers in your hand the internet was exploding people wanted the internet in that pocket knock you miss that unda paid a very heavy price so for about fifteen minutes down the road from the town of Nokia its of the biggest city in the straw Finland it\u0027s Tampa it\u0027s the old industrial heartland unsteady in the central square just outside the town hall and around me at this smoke stacks of old red brick warehouses and factories that tell the story of the industrial past of the city but more recently it\u0027s been Nokia that has dominated this local economy this one is to be one of our an old paper mill then there\u0027s an old factory signed off on the right here car you can color is director of economic and urban development for the city of tempera when not his main research and development sites once employed four thousand hightech skilled workers around three quarters of those jobs are now gone along with thousands of handset manufacturing jobs in other parts of the country no he was huge in Finland by all indicators for example of the are Andy spending so the nation ninety Nokia\u0027s peak one third came from public sector one third came third came yeah and that\u0027s national it was the backbone old everything here the university\u0027s relied on our extensive collaboration with Nokia the kids were relying on being employed by Nokia now we have horrendous unemployment situation currently for Finland the malaise of Nokia could not have come at a worse time since the financial crisis the economy\u0027s struggle to emerge from session not his failure is emblematic of a wider economic malaise but for a new generation to finish tech entrepreneurs it represents such unity I had a son Thomas cook them on the site late for that Celinda pickup in Helsinki humus spent most of his career working for Nokia as a software engineer spending several years in California\u0027s Silicon Valley now he\u0027s returned home to help cultivates Finland\u0027s post Nokia tech startup scene he shows me around his new offices for I know where an imprint of whatever it\u0027s one of the older district so one of the trendier once nowadays space were in right now it\u0027s an old factory it\u0027s feels like a very tech startup environment is a table full table and Mike is a swing everyday what what happens in the swing we actually had to have two functional swings they\u0027re just decorate some some make it look like very trendy Fatima\u0027s Nokia\u0027s legacy is a wealth of talent and expertise waiting to be tapped the talent hasn\u0027t really gone anywhere the share magnitude of Nokia in Finland means that there\u0027s a pool of big talent but how has experience in the field have deep specialized knowledge in certain areas that you you not gain by going through an educational some but Finland thing was buzzing with with high tech you know skills and I\u0027m I\u0027m startups before I look around I see a lot of smaller companies that are trying to make a big impact on the mark holding owns those skills and learning the lessons of Nokia\u0027s failures may be key to determining whether Finland will again lead the world in technology but back in the snow of temper former Nokia manages secco ha Thea and Micah green stream say that a company of Nokia\u0027s dominance and size is unlikely to be seen again does he doesn\u0027t he said saying sing so that they know racers are maybe not coming through the big companies it sass more companies start up companies summation of course business and likes to have something that they can say one thing one one sportsman no one company or whatever but now maybe I will move to a phase of people like that they\u0027re all different kind of stories and it\u0027s more diverse that report that from the BBC\u0027s Edwin lane in Finland we have a dedicated to save the rhino if we\u0027re lucky that was the message from prince William that you came which today as he unveiled an agreement to crack down on illegal wildlife trade routes worldwide he said the rhino could even be extinct within five years unless more was done to protect it the next five to ten years of personals a massive change a dramatic change in the way really appreciates and protects these iconic species in Africa that would be these incredible animals that which not only is obviously side for future generations but I think it would be incredibly devastating for humanity itself when we I\u0027ve sat back and we\u0027ve lost something that we\u0027ve been responsible for if we haven\u0027t achieved something with the next five ten years then we will be almost impossible to do anything else laughs because the numbers will be surgically saves the damage will be done so badly and clearly the Dimond way to be hoaxes the agreement is being called the Buckingham Palace declaration after where was signed leaders of global airlines shipping firms port operators and customs agencies have agreed to do more to prevent the illegal trade in endangered species I\u0027m Cali see Sibanda ease regional officer for East Africa the worldwide fund for nature how helpful did he think the new agreement was the Buckingham Palace said declaration is that represents a step change in our fight against illegal wildlife trade around the world and we are saying through it that it\u0027s going to become a high risk business at being involved in this kind of criminality but presumably wildlife traffic is a clever when it comes to hiding that tracks what more can the companies said that are involved in this declaration that transport companies airlines ports operators what more can they do to try to expose what\u0027s going on realistically do you think through this declaration with saying that let\u0027s let\u0027s come together caught in a tie efforts in giving information in making sure that the next part has the information that they require that they have people who are able to to to identify those products and making sure that we catch the criminals that actually putting his products in the airlines and getting them through our parts and you know planes and I sheeps how much progress then are we making into as a getting on top of this problem in terms of making endangered species less and then did the rhino for example prince William says what we could have just five years before the run it becomes extinct are we making progress we making incredible progress and we working in the countries where there is a product of being sold in between the sauce and where it\u0027s being sold we are now cutting that link and saying the transporters and artists and the public are working together to say that he\u0027s not as zero tolerance for any tread in between those places and that that will go a long way in ensuring that we have zero poaching in the future what about the issue of demand to though that the still a lot of demand for example for rhino horn from an increasingly affluent Asian middle class and like China and Vietnam rhino horns prize for medicines I think that it is a little search of work to be done on the demand side we certainly have been working with the wrench states with the demand countries to educate the the population about the fact that actually are for example the rhinos where people think that it it meant it has medicinal purposes that that is not so we working hard with that those countries to make sure that anyone that that is selling the rhino horns ivory is caught and sentenced appropriately so we reckon with the costs we reckon with the wildlife fat authorities that we increasing security and dealt with a but authorities as well I was thinking that you actually see Sibanda at the worldwide fund for nature it\u0027s the richest sports in the world and the most popular in the United States but just how dangerous is American football that\u0027s been heated debates about the long term impact of head injuries thousands of former National Football League or NFL players have sued for damages a federal judge has approved a one billion dollar compensation package currently on hold pending the outcome of an appeal now in what some believe could be a watershed moment atop NFL executive said there is a link between the sports and it degenerative brain disease health and safety officer Jeff Miller acknowledge before Congress that there is a connection between football related brain trauma and a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE E. Chris Nowinski co founder of a Boston charity called the concussion legacy foundation gave me his reaction I\u0027m very happy to hear the NFL finally admit that they believe there is a link between playing football and developing chronic dramatic encephalopathies for the last ten years since the first discovery of this disease the football player was made they\u0027ve actually denied that they thought football was the cause of this what you think significance will be in terms of the legal action that we\u0027ve seen from former players it\u0027s hard to say I\u0027ve been reading that some lawyers think that they won\u0027t change anything other one hold out hope that this admission I\u0027ll change the course of the settlement because what\u0027s interesting about the settlement between former NFL players in the NFL is that the settlement does not cover a diagnosis of chronic somatic encephalopathies the only disease that we really think is linked to playing football the other diseases covers that link has yet to be established as strongly as he interesting because we haven\u0027t seen the debate here in the UK about sa rugby noticeable this massive in the U. S. but whether schools should really be allowed to go in for full on tackling in rugby so there is a real debate isn\u0027t there across all sorts of sports around the world about trying to make them safer there is and there should be mean we we have established in this disease was first established in boxers and everyone sort of course boxers get see either punch drunk in each other and head and this is what happens and now we finally opened up our eyes to the fact that getting punched in the head is not any different than guitar playing football and colliding with your head or having a soccer ball or tackling and rugby in having your head fall off someone\u0027s knee snow in skip the concussion legacy foundation in ofertas nickel will be back with business matters an hour of business news and comment at one o\u0027clock GMT here on the world service thanks listing their to this world business report there are many ways to keep up with the BBC world service join us on social media all sign of a pub costs and BBC world service dot com slash part because ",

    "text": "this is world business report from the BBC world service I\u0027m Susanna\u0027s Teresa the German government vans to stick with its refugee policy despite gains by the anti immigration far right does show that the country\u0027s very polarized ray fragmented and it could be that medical will draw some comfort from all this she is weakened but all her interest rates have also been weakened in different ways Green Party also win control of a regional parliament well the results have repercussions that German economic policy plus that French investigators say the pilot to deliberately crashed a passenger aircraft was showing signs of psychosis do doctors need new guidance about went to flag up patients who are a threat to the public we do understand that there is some confusion there among some doctors about that line where it is to be drawn and what the limits of confidentiality should be and that is the big lesson from this particular a report plus he comes the sun a huge solar power plant goes live in South Africa the project like Bob would will of course ones running be able to be a continuous operator and show the world that effectively assist the plant would storage can compete with conventional thumb about plans that\u0027s all coming up that fast it was a difficult day German chancellor Angela Merkel\u0027s was today she reflected on the pool regional election results for her conservative Christian Democrats policy significant gains by the anti immigrant AFT policy at the expense of the CD you have been put down to discontent with Mrs knuckles open door policy on migration speaking at a news conference in Berlin she acknowledge that frustration about immigration was one of the reasons for the poll result but set that would be no change in policy es mas oud ourselves artist community models predicting the dominating topic was the refugee policy the fact that in the view of the people there is nice truancy a significant influence on the result of the election I strongly believe and this wasn\u0027t question today that we need a European solution but there is no sustainable solution yet over four hundred how stunts on migrants has been backed by the leader of the Green Party which also made significant gains in Baden Baden but the greens became the biggest policy in a regional parliament for the first time so it begins on the left and also to the far right it\u0027s clear that many voters want to change to the status quo so what could that mean for economic policy and a country considered to be the powerhouse of Europe well first of all aspects of the general secretary of the Green Party in Germany Michael Kellner Walser historic success what\u0027s that the first time ever in German history that the Green Party came out strongest party in one of the major land that in Germany in Barton looking back really you\u0027ve successfully now one reason this movie our front runner vin Creta Kretschmann he did a marvelous campaign what is you\u0027ll economic policy that you communicated to voters in a way regretful that and in a state where strong German industries spotlight congresses in the way that we want Saddam as green so the green to future we not thinking to get high environmental issues and economic issues and death wanna kind of agreeing transformation also wealth in he\u0027s in a way told a story that that in green ideas allies to future also hoodlum industries you policy leader has also been supportive of Angola miracles policy on migrants do you see migrants is the future for Germany in the numbers that they have and took the country Germany meets migrations buckets also a quite a challenge to cope with want peace large numbers of of refugees in Germany we need you clean solution to these questions source of it was a very pro European approach this in the campaign and this was clearly that we support argued a miracle and in her way to find the you Michael cannon that\u0027s on the Green Party in Germany leather tricks when destroys the MEP of the anti immigration a hefty policy I asked her why she thought how close he had made such significant gains we have such a success at the very moment because all the other parties which a running do not focus on what is in the concerns of the people and of course we had a huge debate about migration which is all the case all over here Europe and we have a god who is going very very key line on the migration issue I we want to because of August and we said that we can\u0027t take more refugees focusing on the economy projections show that Germany needs an or for loss of migration for it to really function in the coming decades im pay for all the pensions for example of those taxes need days surely these refugees could really help plug that gap over what some people say that that they start to realize that people coming to us but not the kind of migrants we need what we need is highly educated people and what we see is that those people coming to earth in the vast majority not highly educated and not not able to be highly educated so what we need is labor force and what we get is migrants which we did not choose that many of those people coming from Syria are highly educated record this is just one of those talks which is just not true and it doesn\u0027t get more troops and more often you repeated the vast majority of people we get our hero and also that I\u0027m so this is nothing which is itself also used for labor market which is focusing on highly educated article that was businessman story from the a FDC policy while David mouse\u0027s head of the official monetary and financial institutions forum I\u0027ll ask him if he was surprised by the results it is something of an earthquake if you simply look at it and statistical terms this is really the first time since the reverse of German democracy after the second World War that you\u0027ve had a right wing populist policies come to the surface in such a big way across a whole swathe of Germany novel party called a hefty present in a state parliaments and they came actually from New three states to state parliament time is certainly given charge of a medical something of a bloody nose in terms of showing but her policy on migration and is very very unpopular but in real terms in terms of what this means for her as a leader she can probably draw some comfort from is paradoxically enough because her coalition partners the Social Democratic Party they did very badly much person her party did so she is still the only woman standing here on the German political scene and the greens have also maze games haven\u0027t may taking over a rule controlled the regional parliament for the first time and they have supported Mrs Michael starts on migration as well haven\u0027t may is shows how fragmented the German scene is because the greens did very well in Baden Baden bag which one of the most wealthy parts of Germany very industrial so basically you wouldn\u0027t imagine the greens would do all that well created great well they\u0027re very badly and neighboring violent listening to showing regional sensibilities tradition that the country\u0027s very polarized a very fragmented but doesn\u0027t give one universal message this whole series of rather fragmentary messages and it could be that medical will draw some comfort from all this she is weakened but all her adversaries have also been ways and given that it seems politically the country\u0027s becoming so polarize it will be difficult romantic to try and draw some of those economic policies that set the rifles who make great gains have been trying to promote to the electorate ch it will be hard to draw those in well into an appeal to a wider base in future elections the ASD don\u0027t really have any policies on the economy close to the Europa Germany\u0027s in the year is gonna be favorite genesis came you\u0027re right we do know that the SeniorNet government in Berlin the one that Mrs Meg who is in charge of with a Christian Democrats they\u0027re going to have to take a more pragmatic live on austerity and basically over issues some of the budgetary targets anyway because of the huge amount of pressure on public spending caused by the influx of refugees so already the economic policy has changed and the facts are and they will be much less a finger wagging at the other European countries by Mrs medical and her friends in the government because they actually need some solidarity from the other country as well so I believe the true fixes may well be the government\u0027s involves and initially with Mr alongs understood principle that backs against the wall domestically they both need a bit of extra German understanding over their own budget stream problems and they may not get it because Michael is weaker and she needs friends abroad and those people in Paris and a roommate just turn out to be this friend and that was David mas head of the official monetary and financial institutions forum let\u0027s check in now with the financial markets and Jerry that stone call from Charleston is with me tell me you\u0027ve been watching the results of those elections with interest the European central banks Domenici policies very controversial in Japanese net I Hoces other yes it is Sir the Germans have historically feuds European central bank policy extreme skeptically particular course decisions take the overnight interest rates further into negative territory I actually happen to agree with quite a lot of what I heard in those reports that I thought that Sir it\u0027s fair to say the Serb wells miracles power base has been eroded so has thus of some of her major competitors but of course it\u0027s a CD you see S. U. coalition and I just since the alternative Deutschlands at this up and coming policy is rather like the National Front policy in Paris you know young firebrand leader the map of Europe that is changing a new generation of political leaders is beginning to emerge so I would not belittle this results and I think it would be a huge mistake the medical and her supporters to blisters this could be the start of something sticky with immigration of course going back on the radar screens we get the summer look at the wider market oil has dropped back again what\u0027s driving that I\u0027m well of following a real supportive comment from the I. E. A. on Friday evening we had opaque delivering a dose of reality late this afternoon OPEC arguing that due to weak global economic activity demand for oil is going to be very subdued and therefore there will be higher surplus as yet nothing has been done to address the difference between supply which is substantial and amount which is weak and of course nothing that any of the producers as saying at the moment lenses sell to any kind of agreement to cut output okay demi about sick of them tell Sonny many thanks the latest numbers for you the footsie one hundred thirty four points to sixty one seventy four and a New York the Dow Jones up thus it seventeen thousand two hundred and forty four you\u0027re listening to well business report from the BBC world service still to come it\u0027s now becoming Valga to boast about how long you walk shorts allies equal high status more from Lucy Callaway from the Financial Times coming up the pilots who flew the Germanwings Ashcroft into a French mountainside killing one hundred and fifty people on board was showing signs of psychosis that\u0027s among the findings of investigators who\u0027ve been prepping the causes of the crash a gimmick at twenty seven year old Andreas lubitz who was suffering from depression was allowed to continue flying despite having been seen by doctors dozens of times in the preceding days their votes called folk cables on the lifting of medical confidentiality of pilot show signs of psychological problems the BBC\u0027s their luggage was been following the story and he told me more about the findings pretty clear that the co pilot had a history of depressive illness and that\u0027s in the weeks before the accident he consulted a number of different doctors several of whom had issued medical certificate sunset nights exempt him from work one doctor had actually diagnosed a possible psychosis and recommended a hospitalization until he\u0027d recovered do you know why he hadn\u0027t done so is does this report go into to detail about this as well well it\u0027s pretty clear that he didn\u0027t tell anybody about it and he didn\u0027t contact any of the pilots organizations that have been set up to provide sort of pit support for pilots who might be in this kind of condition another report speculates on not to suggest that one reason why he may not sort of like to the authorities to his own condition was because he was suffering possibly a psychosis which is a distancing from reality so he may not have been thinking clearly and not so but that was also a very strong financial motive for him to stay quiet because if he had alerted the authorities that he was suffering from depression that he was also incidently on anti depressant medicine and sleeping pills it\u0027s highly likely he would have been considered unfit to fly and would have been removed from duties now that would have hit his income he did have insurance to cover some of his debts which he\u0027d run up in his pilot training but he wouldn\u0027t of had any other means for carrying out his day to day life a great many people died on board both passengers and crew all that family saying anything about this report the families have all along been very critical of love Tanza the parent company of Germanwings saying that more should have been done potentially to provide support for the the pilot to weed out pilots who have potentially problematic mental conditions but on the other hand you have pilots unions who say that too much psychological screening could be a bad thing that pilots could be unnecessarily removed from duty while investigations occurring on and don\u0027t forget that Andreas lubitz wants regularly recessed his psychiatric condition was assessed the with the nose on his file that he had suffered depression very early in his career and on each occasion the era medical examiner decided that he was fit to fly and that was the BBC\u0027s their luggage but just how difficult is it for doctors to know when to alert authorities to a potential threat to public health and break patient confidentiality who has a question I put to professor Robert Bork consultant clinical psychologist who assesses the mental health of pilots as part of his job it reminded I\u0027ve ever worked with has always erred on the side of safety themselves they would rather not be working van in the Germanwings scenario with the person so to conceal their difficulties from others and office he to commit suicide in a work setting so that you know I mean it\u0027s an incredibly rare experience in aviation so for the very fast majority opined that we see it won\u0027t ever get to that point shouldn\u0027t be honest be on the doctors to think this person\u0027s condition has deteriorated and it\u0027s now a public safety issue absolutely and in fact that is always I think understood and it\u0027s about the world over with any pilot who goes to a doctor and that talk to feel you know whether it\u0027s visual impairment or some kind of mental problem that they could be some jeopardy to safety would act in in some way arm to ensure that that person was receiving the right treatment what appears to have happened here now that we have read reported that there was a failure of communication between the civilian doctors in Germany and I think what is important here is the the civilian doctors and not part of the aviation specialization and they\u0027re in Germany and we do understand that there is some confusion there among some doctors about that line where it is to be drawn and what the limits of confidentiality should be and that is the big lesson from this particular a report in other countries do you think that line is drawn sufficiently my understanding is that the line is actually very clear doctors don\u0027t like to breach confidentiality ever I think they will always do so very reluctantly but in weighing up the threat to our public harm that is something that is for most a lot more straightforward and in certain kinds Norway and Israel it is meant date tree for a civilian doctor who believes that the pilot maybe in some jeopardy or is likely to cause harm to the population but to and to break confidentiality and to report this they shouldn\u0027t invade mandates mean all countries I think it is understood to be that is the extent to which doctors will implement it I don\u0027t think that the laws need change to adjustment my understanding is that they need to be properly adhered to and that\u0027s what didn\u0027t happen in this particular case Hudson could hide some of the symptoms from doctors because they feel as though that career would be over if they showed certain symptoms which could and that Korea for that put probably happened in this case here the fear that he would lose his job prevented him from doing the most honest and all the thing that he should have done but there are other systems in place and other people who come to who we encounter who have you know act as a fullback so for example every time a policy that the controlled opiate copilot\u0027s observing them fights when they go out for a crew rest there is a dispatcher sometimes passengers and other crew members will also observed that parted so the likelihood of that happening is incredibly infrequent that we look back in the last thirty years we understand that there probably being around six or seven pilot suicides and although everyone of that is completely unacceptable emphatically actual numbers that are involved here remains incredibly lows and so it is still a very safe system provided everybody exercising the right judgment and that was princess and wild boar consultant clinical psychologists stretching as far as the eye can see huge fields of solar panels have been switched on in South Africa to try and plug the country\u0027s electricity deficit just two weeks after George apple became the first on the continent to be powered by energy from the sun huge solar energy and storage plant opened today in the Northern Cape province it\u0027ll have one of the world\u0027s biggest solo Brady seller radiation footprints and promises to generate enough power for a course at the million homes day and tonight I spoke to the managing director of the plant none do Buddha and he\u0027d tell me more about how the technology works well they parabolic trough so they effectively concave couple of murders that reflect the sun\u0027s light onto a central troop this running along it so you have room fields of these concave mirrors that have achieved in it and we have HTF which is high temperature fluid that\u0027s flying through it and that is used as your eating fluid to eventually drive a steam turbine South Africa has really suffered with blackouts over recent years to what extent will this plug help plug the energy deficit well this is one of many plans that I actually supporting the south African grid and in particular Eskom as the sole provider of power in the country so that IPP programs been extremely successful in that we got pretty close to three thousand megawatts to the grid and providing relief to the though the current good ball utility so from that perspective yes this is the spot plays a huge role is also low class in the sense that it now has the thermal storage system and wished allows the plant to be not only a renewable generator but also a baseload continuous operator this push for renewables is being driven by the south African government but given the huge investment costs of this type of technology it could be in a fifteen twenty years before I feel actually pays for itself couldn\u0027t it wouldn\u0027t it be cheaper ready to invest in something that\u0027s not renewable at this current time was oil prices so depressed I think that\u0027s that\u0027s actually not quite true because of the price reduction in over the various bits process is that the south African government have put on the table we started of with around one bids with the IPP program which had quite high prices but if you look at the place will be outlawed now it round three going to run for the prices have really dive to a point where we are almost at parity with conventional power prices so the the conventional politicians don\u0027t have much on that rely on the renewable program right now on and the fact that we are now having see is people on that is becoming cost competitive with storage making them also despicable Powell plans they become extensively equally competitive even so South Africa is still pretty reliant on call how to try and persuade policy makers not just in South Africa but in other parts of the world rarely that this is the time to switch well I mean the the the issue here is to show success in projects like book work so the project like Bob would will of course ones running be able to be of a continuous operator and show the world that effectively assisted bloodwood storage can compete with conventional thumb about blogs the thing is that in other parts of the world it\u0027s to simply notice Sonny is South Africa they really still does need to be a mix of both the traditional technology is like coal and gas and renewables doesn\u0027t now no definitely I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s a good out there that needs to be solely solar I think solar can complement current technologies countries like South Africa have a benefit of a world of us resourcing in Colin Powell\u0027s so we must use that that is ninety percent of our current technology base however we are diversifying would bring in wind brilliancy SP and and other additional investment in nuclear put potentially so that I think it\u0027s you require div diverse mix it also spread your risk and to bring technology close to the ground so that at least we have different options to consider it depending on your your your atmospheric conditions and the mental resources that you have available I thought that was the MD at the plant and do Pula how are you listening to this in a car honking away through traffic head down with headphones in racing into work or are you attempting to do the dishes and cook dinner simultaneously while overseeing homework anyway however you\u0027re listening is it time perhaps for you to slow down a little Lucy Callaway the Financial Times thinks her explains why mostly because social event for senior bank because that was a discussion on what people were trying to give up almost everyone was trying to go a few weeks without alcohol about from one man he said he was trying to give up something much tougher he was trying to quit excessive walk not just for a few weeks but for the rest of his life he was fed up with pointless meetings and of emailing at eleven PM sisters in couple of weeks earlier he had achieved just as much as before but on average had worked no more than seven hours a day and spent the rest of his time enjoying himself that\u0027s nothing extraordinary about this it all makes perfect sense work expands to fill the time available and all that and this man was senior enough to dictate his own schedule but the reason I make so much of this story is that for the past two decades overpaid professionals have been not just working around the clock but boasting about it to get here was someone at the top of a competitive workaholic industry trying to make himself seem even bigger in the eyes of his pairs not by saying how much she was but how little it\u0027s possible that this is the beginning of something big Bucks and Russell and John may not Keynes both predicted this in the nineteen thirties it\u0027s been a long time coming but maybe it\u0027s happening lost she told me that in and lead to executive circles in the U. S. things are beginning to change justice it\u0027s vulgar to post about how much you consume it\u0027s now becoming Valga to boast about how long you walk is a vanguard of people she claimed who is starting to make the sort of post my banker was making shorts allies equal high status at the time I like to have very but saw no signs of it being true instead what I saw were the friends of my children starting out in consulting on the Lowell not only did they seem to work longer hours than ever they look down on anyone who left work at six PM but now I\u0027m wondering if half and I might be right self rule for years employers in Sweden a country that was never a fan of either working have been experimenting with a six hour day there are signs that workaholic Anglo Saxons are looking on with approval rather than superiority the independent newspapers just run an online poll asking whether a similar experiment impression would make after a more productive about ninety five percent said it would as my bank has bug I studied the faces of the water swelling man he was addressing one snorted and said good luck with that but the other four item with what looked like resentment laced with pure envy and other words his boast worked magnificently our correspondent for the Financial Times via some breaking news now on the BBC Russian president Vladimir Putin has ordered the military to withdraw the main part of the forces in Syria saying they had largely achieved that goals the Palat will start on Tuesday more coming up from BBC news on that but thanks for listening to wealth business reports from all of us here good bye there are many ways to keep up with the BBC world service join us on social media or sign of a pot costs and BBC world service dot com slash part because ",

also been weakened in different ways Green Party also win control of a regional parliament well the results have repercussions that German economic policy plus that French investigators say the pilot to deliberately crashed a passenger aircraft was showing signs of psychosis do doctors need new guidance about went to flag up patients who are a threat to the public we do understand that there is some confusion there among some doctors about that line where it is to be drawn and what the limits of confidentiality should be and that is the big lesson from this particular a report plus he comes the sun a huge solar power plant goes live in South Africa the project like Bob would will of course ones running be able to be a continuous operator and show the world that effectively assist the plant would storage can compete with conventional thumb about plans that\u0027s all coming up that fast it was a difficult day German chancellor Angela Merkel\u0027s was today she reflected on the pool regional election results for her conservative Christian Democrats policy significant gains by the anti immigrant AFT policy at the expense of the CD you have been put down to discontent with Mrs knuckles open door policy on migration speaking at a news conference in Berlin she acknowledge that frustration about immigration was one of the reasons for the poll result but set that would be no change in policy es mas oud ourselves artist community models predicting the dominating topic was the refugee policy the fact that in the view of the people there is nice truancy a significant influence on the result of the election I strongly believe and this wasn\u0027t question today that we need a European solution but there is no sustainable solution yet over four hundred how stunts on migrants has been backed by the leader of the Green Party which also made significant gains in Baden Baden but the greens became the biggest policy in a regional parliament for the first time so it begins on the left and also to the far right it\u0027s clear that many voters want to change to the status quo so what could that mean for economic policy and a country considered to be the powerhouse of Europe well first of all aspects of the general secretary of the Green Party in Germany Michael Kellner Walser historic success what\u0027s that the first time ever in German history that the Green Party came out strongest party in one of the major land that in Germany in Barton looking back really you\u0027ve successfully now one reason this movie our front runner vin Creta Kretschmann he did a marvelous campaign what is you\u0027ll economic policy that you communicated to voters in a way regretful that and in a state where strong German industries spotlight congresses in the way that we want Saddam as green so the green to future we not thinking to get high environmental issues and economic issues and death wanna kind of agreeing transformation also wealth in he\u0027s in a way told a story that that in green ideas allies to future also hoodlum industries you policy leader has also been supportive of Angola miracles policy on migrants do you see migrants is the future for Germany in the numbers that they have and took the country Germany meets migrations buckets also a quite a challenge to cope with want peace large numbers of of refugees in Germany we need you clean solution to these questions source of it was a very pro European approach this in the campaign and this was clearly that we support argued a miracle and in her way to find the you Michael cannon that\u0027s on the Green Party in Germany leather tricks when destroys the MEP of the anti immigration a hefty policy I asked her why she thought how close he had made such significant gains we have such a success at the very moment because all the other parties which a running do not focus on what is in the concerns of the people and of course we had a huge debate about migration which is all the case all over here Europe and we have a god who is going very very key line on the migration issue I we want to because of August and we said that we can\u0027t take more refugees focusing on the economy projections show that Germany needs an or for loss of migration for it to really function in the coming decades im pay for all the pensions for example of those taxes need days surely these refugees could really help plug that gap over what some people say that that they start to realize that people coming to us but not the kind of migrants we need what we need is highly educated people and what we see is that those people coming to earth in the vast majority not highly educated and not not able to be highly educated so what we need is labor force and what we get is migrants which we did not choose that many of those people coming from Syria are highly educated record this is just one of those talks which is just not true and it doesn\u0027t get more troops and more often you repeated the vast majority of people we get our hero and also that I\u0027m so this is nothing which is itself also used for labor market which is focusing on highly educated article that was businessman story from the a FDC policy while David mouse\u0027s head of the official monetary and financial institutions forum I\u0027ll ask him if he was surprised by the results it is something of an earthquake if you simply look at it and statistical terms this is really the first time since the reverse of German democracy after the second World War that you\u0027ve had a right wing populist policies come to the surface in such a big way across a whole swathe of Germany novel party called a hefty present in a state parliaments and they came actually from New three states to state parliament time is certainly given charge of a medical something of a bloody nose in terms of showing but her policy on migration and is very very unpopular but in real terms in terms of what this means for her as a leader she can probably draw some comfort from is paradoxically enough because her coalition partners the Social Democratic Party they did very badly much person her party did so she is still the only woman standing here on the German political scene and the greens have also maze games haven\u0027t may taking over a rule controlled the regional parliament for the first time and they have supported Mrs Michael starts on migration as well haven\u0027t may is shows how fragmented the German scene is because the greens did very well in Baden Baden bag which one of the most wealthy parts of Germany very industrial so basically you wouldn\u0027t imagine the greens would do all that well created great well they\u0027re very badly and neighboring violent listening to showing regional sensibilities tradition that the country\u0027s very polarized a very fragmented but doesn\u0027t give one universal message this whole series of rather fragmentary messages and it could be that medical will draw some comfort from all this she is weakened but all her adversaries have also been ways and given that it seems politically the country\u0027s becoming so polarize it will be difficult romantic to try and draw some of those economic policies that set the rifles who make great gains have been trying to promote to the electorate ch it will be hard to draw those in well into an appeal to a wider base in future elections the ASD don\u0027t really have any policies on the economy close to the Europa Germany\u0027s in the year is gonna be favorite genesis came you\u0027re right we do know that the SeniorNet government in Berlin the one that Mrs Meg who is in charge of with a Christian Democrats they\u0027re going to have to take a more pragmatic live on austerity and basically over issues some of the budgetary targets anyway because of the huge amount of pressure on public spending caused by the influx of refugees so already the economic policy has changed and the facts are and they will be much less a finger wagging at the other European countries by Mrs medical and her friends in the government because they actually need some solidarity from the other country as well so I believe the true fixes may well be the government\u0027s involves and initially with Mr alongs understood principle that backs against the wall domestically they both need a bit of extra German understanding over their own budget stream problems and they may not get it because Michael is weaker and she needs friends abroad and those people in Paris and a roommate just turn out to be this friend and that was David mas head of the official monetary and financial institutions forum let\u0027s check in now with the financial markets and Jerry that stone call from Charleston is with me tell me you\u0027ve been watching the results of those elections with interest the European central banks Domenici policies very controversial in Japanese net I Hoces other yes it is Sir the Germans have historically feuds European central bank policy extreme skeptically particular course decisions take the overnight interest rates further into negative territory I actually happen to agree with quite a lot of what I heard in those reports that I thought that Sir it\u0027s fair to say the Serb wells miracles power base has been eroded so has thus of some of her major competitors but of course it\u0027s a CD you see S. U. coalition and I just since the alternative Deutschlands at this up and coming policy is rather like the National Front policy in Paris you know young firebrand leader the map of Europe that is changing a new generation of political leaders is beginning to emerge so I would not belittle this results and I think it would be a huge mistake the medical and her supporters to blisters this could be the start of something sticky with immigration of course going back on the radar screens we get the summer look at the wider market oil has dropped back again what\u0027s driving that I\u0027m well of following a real supportive comment from the I. E. A. on Friday evening we had opaque delivering a dose of reality late this afternoon OPEC arguing that due to weak global economic activity demand for oil is going to be very subdued and therefore there will be higher surplus as yet nothing has been done to address the difference between supply which is substantial and amount which is weak and of course nothing that any of the producers as saying at the moment lenses sell to any kind of agreement to cut output okay demi about sick of them tell Sonny many thanks the latest numbers for you the footsie one hundred thirty four points to sixty one seventy four and a New York the Dow Jones up thus it seventeen thousand two hundred and forty four you\u0027re listening to well business report from the BBC world service still to come it\u0027s now becoming Valga to boast about how long you walk shorts allies equal high status more from Lucy Callaway from the Financial Times coming up the pilots who flew the Germanwings Ashcroft into a French mountainside killing one hundred and fifty people on board was showing signs of psychosis that\u0027s among the findings of investigators who\u0027ve been prepping the causes of the crash a gimmick at twenty seven year old Andreas lubitz who was suffering from depression was allowed to continue flying despite having been seen by doctors dozens of times in the preceding days their votes called folk cables on the lifting of medical confidentiality of pilot show signs of psychological problems the BBC\u0027s their luggage was been following the story and he told me more about the findings pretty clear that the co pilot had a history of depressive illness and that\u0027s in the weeks before the accident he consulted a number of different doctors several of whom had issued medical certificate sunset nights exempt him from work one doctor had actually diagnosed a possible psychosis and recommended a hospitalization until he\u0027d recovered do you know why he hadn\u0027t done so is does this report go into to detail about this as well well it\u0027s pretty clear that he didn\u0027t tell anybody about it and he didn\u0027t contact any of the pilots organizations that have been set up to provide sort of pit support for pilots who might be in this kind of condition another report speculates on not to suggest that one reason why he may not sort of like to the authorities to his own condition was because he was suffering possibly a psychosis which is a distancing from reality so he may not have been thinking clearly and not so but that was also a very strong financial motive for him to stay quiet because if he had alerted the authorities that he was suffering from depression that he was also incidently on anti depressant medicine and sleeping pills it\u0027s highly likely he would have been considered unfit to fly and would have been removed from duties now that would have hit his income he did have insurance to cover some of his debts which he\u0027d run up in his pilot training but he wouldn\u0027t of had any other means for carrying out his day to day life a great many people died on board both passengers and crew all that family saying anything about this report the families have all along been very critical of love Tanza the parent company of Germanwings saying that more should have been done potentially to provide support for the the pilot to weed out pilots who have potentially problematic mental conditions but on the other hand you have pilots unions who say that too much psychological screening could be a bad thing that pilots could be unnecessarily removed from duty while investigations occurring on and don\u0027t forget that Andreas lubitz wants regularly recessed his psychiatric condition was assessed the with the nose on his file that he had suffered depression very early in his career and on each occasion the era medical examiner decided that he was fit to fly and that was the BBC\u0027s their luggage but just how difficult is it for doctors to know when to alert authorities to a potential threat to public health and break patient confidentiality who has a question I put to professor Robert Bork consultant clinical psychologist who assesses the mental health of pilots as part of his job it reminded I\u0027ve ever worked with has always erred on the side of safety themselves they would rather not be working van in the Germanwings scenario with the person so to conceal their difficulties from others and office he to commit suicide in a work setting so that you know I mean it\u0027s an incredibly rare experience in aviation so for the very fast majority opined that we see it won\u0027t ever get to that point shouldn\u0027t be honest be on the doctors to think this person\u0027s condition has deteriorated and it\u0027s now a public safety issue absolutely and in fact that is always I think understood and it\u0027s about the world over with any pilot who goes to a doctor and that talk to feel you know whether it\u0027s visual impairment or some kind of mental problem that they could be some jeopardy to safety would act in in some way arm to ensure that that person was receiving the right treatment what appears to have happened here now that we have read reported that there was a failure of communication between the civilian doctors in Germany and I think what is important here is the the civilian doctors and not part of the aviation specialization and they\u0027re in Germany and we do understand that there is some confusion there among some doctors about that line where it is to be drawn and what the limits of confidentiality should be and that is the big lesson from this particular a report in other countries do you think that line is drawn sufficiently my understanding is that the line is actually very clear doctors don\u0027t like to breach confidentiality ever I think they will always do so very reluctantly but in weighing up the threat to our public harm that is something that is for most a lot more straightforward and in certain kinds Norway and Israel it is meant date tree for a civilian doctor who believes that the pilot maybe in some

that Korea for that put probably happened in this case here the fear that he would lose his job prevented him from doing the most honest and all the thing that he should have done but there are other

when they go out for a crew rest there is a dispatcher sometimes passengers and other crew members will also observed that parted so the likelihood of that happening is incredibly infrequent that we look back in the last thirty years we understand that there probably being around six or seven pilot suicides and although everyone of that is completely unacceptable emphatically actual numbers that are involved here remains incredibly lows and so it is still a very safe system provided everybody exercising the right judgment and that was princess and wild boar consultant clinical psychologists stretching as far as the eye can see huge fields of solar panels have been switched on in South Africa to try and plug the country\u0027s electricity deficit just two weeks after George apple became

have room fields of these concave mirrors that have achieved in it and we have HTF which is high temperature fluid that\u0027s flying through it and that is used as your eating fluid to eventually drive a steam turbine South Africa has really suffered with blackouts over recent years to what extent will this plug help plug the energy deficit well this is one of many plans that I actually supporting the south African grid and in particular Eskom as the sole provider of power in the country so that IPP programs been extremely successful in that we got pretty close to three thousand megawatts to the grid and providing relief to the though the current good ball utility so from that perspective yes this is the spot plays a huge role is also low class in the sense that it now has the thermal storage system and wished allows the plant to be not only a renewable generator but also a baseload continuous operator this push for renewables is being driven by the south African government but given the huge investment costs of this type of technology it could be in a fifteen twenty years before I feel actually pays for itself couldn\u0027t it wouldn\u0027t it be cheaper ready to invest in something that\u0027s not renewable at this current time was oil prices so depressed I think that\u0027s that\u0027s actually not quite true because of the price reduction in over the various bits process is that the south African government have put on the table we started of with around one bids with the IPP program which had quite high prices but if you look at the place will be outlawed now it round three going to run for the prices have really dive to a point where we are almost at parity with conventional power prices so the the conventional politicians don\u0027t have much on that rely on the renewable program right now on and the fact that we are now having see is people on that is becoming cost competitive with storage making them also despicable Powell plans they become extensively equally competitive even so South Africa is still pretty reliant on call how to try and persuade policy makers not just in South Africa but in other parts of the world

there\u0027s a good out there that needs to be solely solar I think solar can complement current technologies countries like South Africa have a benefit of a world of us resourcing in Colin

potentially so that I think it\u0027s you require div diverse mix it also spread your risk and to bring technology close to the ground so that at least we have different options to consider it

is it time perhaps for you to slow down a little Lucy Callaway the Financial Times thinks her explains why mostly because social event for senior bank because that was a discussion on what people were trying to give up almost everyone was trying to go a few weeks without alcohol about from one man he said he was trying to give up something much tougher he was trying to quit excessive walk not just for a few weeks but for the rest of his life he was fed up with pointless meetings and of emailing at eleven PM sisters in couple of weeks earlier he had achieved just as much as before but on average had worked no more than seven hours a day and spent the rest of his time enjoying himself that\u0027s nothing extraordinary about this it all makes perfect sense work expands to fill the time available and all that and this man was senior enough to dictate his own schedule but the reason I make so much of this story is that for the past two decades overpaid professionals have been not just working around the clock but boasting about it to get here was someone at the top of a competitive workaholic industry trying to make himself seem even bigger in the eyes of his pairs not by saying how much she was but how little it\u0027s possible that this is the beginning of something big Bucks and Russell and John may not Keynes both predicted this in the nineteen thirties it\u0027s been a long time coming but maybe it\u0027s happening lost she told me that in and lead to executive circles in the U.

also been weakened in different ways Green Party also win control of a regional parliament well the results have repercussions that German economic policy plus that French investigators say the pilot to deliberately crashed a passenger aircraft was showing signs of psychosis do doctors need new guidance about went to flag up patients who are a threat to the public we do understand that there is some confusion there among some doctors about that line where it is to be drawn and what the limits of confidentiality should be and that is the big lesson from this particular a report plus he comes the sun a huge solar power plant goes live in South Africa the project like Bob would will of course ones running be able to be a continuous operator and show the world that effectively assist the plant would storage can compete with conventional thumb about plans that\u0027s all coming up that fast it was a difficult day German chancellor Angela Merkel\u0027s was today she reflected on the pool regional election results for her conservative Christian Democrats policy significant gains by the anti immigrant AFT policy at the expense of the CD you have been put down to discontent with Mrs knuckles open door policy on migration speaking at a news conference in Berlin she acknowledge that frustration about immigration was one of the reasons for the poll result but set that would be no change in policy es mas oud ourselves artist community models predicting the dominating topic was the refugee policy the fact that in the view of the people there is nice truancy a significant influence on the result of the election I strongly believe and this wasn\u0027t question today that we need a European solution but there is no sustainable solution yet over four hundred how stunts on migrants has been backed by the leader of the Green Party which also made significant gains in Baden Baden but the greens became the biggest policy in a regional parliament for the first time so it begins on the left and also to the far right it\u0027s clear that many voters want to change to the status quo so what could that mean for economic policy and a country considered to be the powerhouse of Europe well first of all aspects of the general secretary of the Green Party in Germany Michael Kellner Walser historic success what\u0027s that the first time ever in German history that the Green Party came out strongest party in one of the major land that in Germany in Barton looking back really you\u0027ve successfully now one reason this movie our front runner vin Creta Kretschmann he did a marvelous campaign what is you\u0027ll economic policy that you communicated to voters in a way regretful that and in a state where strong German industries spotlight congresses in the way that we want Saddam as green so the green to future we not thinking to get high environmental issues and economic issues and death wanna kind of agreeing transformation also wealth in he\u0027s in a way told a story that that in green ideas allies to future also hoodlum industries you policy leader has also been supportive of Angola miracles policy on migrants do you see migrants is the future for Germany in the numbers that they have and took the country Germany meets migrations buckets also a quite a challenge to cope with want peace large numbers of of refugees in Germany we need you clean solution to these questions source of it was a very pro European approach this in the campaign and this was clearly that we support argued a miracle and in her way to find the you Michael cannon that\u0027s on the Green Party in Germany leather tricks when destroys the MEP of the anti immigration a hefty policy I asked her why she thought how close he had made such significant gains we have such a success at the very moment because all the other parties which a running do not focus on what is in the concerns of the people and of course we had a huge debate about migration which is all the case all over here Europe and we have a god who is going very very key line on the migration issue I we want to because of August and we said that we can\u0027t take more refugees focusing on the economy projections show that Germany needs an or for loss of migration for it to really function in the coming decades im pay for all the pensions for example of those taxes need days surely these refugees could really help plug that gap over what some people say that that they start to realize that people coming to us but not the kind of migrants we need what we need is highly educated people and what we see is that those people coming to earth in the vast majority not highly educated and not not able to be highly educated so what we need is labor force and what we get is migrants which we did not choose that many of those people coming from Syria are highly educated record this is just one of those talks which is just not true and it doesn\u0027t get more troops and more often you repeated the vast majority of people we get our hero and also that I\u0027m so this is nothing which is itself also used for labor market which is focusing on highly educated article that was businessman story from the a FDC policy while David mouse\u0027s head of the official monetary and financial institutions forum I\u0027ll ask him if he was surprised by the results it is something of an earthquake if you simply look at it and statistical terms this is really the first time since the reverse of German democracy after the second World War that you\u0027ve had a right wing populist policies come to the surface in such a big way across a whole swathe of Germany novel party called a hefty present in a state parliaments and they came actually from New three states to state parliament time is certainly given charge of a medical something of a bloody nose in terms of showing but her policy on migration and is very very unpopular but in real terms in terms of what this means for her as a leader she can probably draw some comfort from is paradoxically enough because her coalition partners the Social Democratic Party they did very badly much person her party did so she is still the only woman standing here on the German political scene and the greens have also maze games haven\u0027t may taking over a rule controlled the regional parliament for the first time and they have supported Mrs Michael starts on migration as well haven\u0027t may is shows how fragmented the German scene is because the greens did very well in Baden Baden bag which one of the most wealthy parts of Germany very industrial so basically you wouldn\u0027t imagine the greens would do all that well created great well they\u0027re very badly and neighboring violent listening to showing regional sensibilities tradition that the country\u0027s very polarized a very fragmented but doesn\u0027t give one universal message this whole series of rather fragmentary messages and it could be that medical will draw some comfort from all this she is weakened but all her adversaries have also been ways and given that it seems politically the country\u0027s becoming so polarize it will be difficult romantic to try and draw some of those economic policies that set the rifles who make great gains have been trying to promote to the electorate ch it will be hard to draw those in well into an appeal to a wider base in future elections the ASD don\u0027t really have any policies on the economy close to the Europa Germany\u0027s in the year is gonna be favorite genesis came you\u0027re right we do know that the SeniorNet government in Berlin the one that Mrs Meg who is in charge of with a Christian Democrats they\u0027re going to have to take a more pragmatic live on austerity and basically over issues some of the budgetary targets anyway because of the huge amount of pressure on public spending caused by the influx of refugees so already the economic policy has changed and the facts are and they will be much less a finger wagging at the other European countries by Mrs medical and her friends in the government because they actually need some solidarity from the other country as well so I believe the true fixes may well be the government\u0027s involves and initially with Mr alongs understood principle that backs against the wall domestically they both need a bit of extra German understanding over their own budget stream problems and they may not get it because Michael is weaker and she needs friends abroad and those people in Paris and a roommate just turn out to be this friend and that was David mas head of the official monetary and financial institutions forum let\u0027s check in now with the financial markets and Jerry that stone call from Charleston is with me tell me you\u0027ve been watching the results of those elections with interest the European central banks Domenici policies very controversial in Japanese net I Hoces other yes it is Sir the Germans have historically feuds European central bank policy extreme skeptically particular course decisions take the overnight interest rates further into negative territory I actually happen to agree with quite a lot of what I heard in those reports that I thought that Sir it\u0027s fair to say the Serb wells miracles power base has been eroded so has thus of some of her major competitors but of course it\u0027s a CD you see S. U. coalition and I just since the alternative Deutschlands at this up and coming policy is rather like the National Front policy in Paris you know young firebrand leader the map of Europe that is changing a new generation of political leaders is beginning to emerge so I would not belittle this results and I think it would be a huge mistake the medical and her supporters to blisters this could be the start of something sticky with immigration of course going back on the radar screens we get the summer look at the wider market oil has dropped back again what\u0027s driving that I\u0027m well of following a real supportive comment from the I. E. A. on Friday evening we had opaque delivering a dose of reality late this afternoon OPEC arguing that due to weak global economic activity demand for oil is going to be very subdued and therefore there will be higher surplus as yet nothing has been done to address the difference between supply which is substantial and amount which is weak and of course nothing that any of the producers as saying at the moment lenses sell to any kind of agreement to cut output okay demi about sick of them tell Sonny many thanks the latest numbers for you the footsie one hundred thirty four points to sixty one seventy four and a New York the Dow Jones up thus it seventeen thousand two hundred and forty four you\u0027re listening to well business report from the BBC world service still to come it\u0027s now becoming Valga to boast about how long you walk shorts allies equal high status more from Lucy Callaway from the Financial Times coming up the pilots who flew the Germanwings Ashcroft into a French mountainside killing one hundred and fifty people on board was showing signs of psychosis that\u0027s among the findings of investigators who\u0027ve been prepping the causes of the crash a gimmick at twenty seven year old Andreas lubitz who was suffering from depression was allowed to continue flying despite having been seen by doctors dozens of times in the preceding days their votes called folk cables on the lifting of medical confidentiality of pilot show signs of psychological problems the BBC\u0027s their luggage was been following the story and he told me more about the findings pretty clear that the co pilot had a history of depressive illness and that\u0027s in the weeks before the accident he consulted a number of different doctors several of whom had issued medical certificate sunset nights exempt him from work one doctor had actually diagnosed a possible psychosis and recommended a hospitalization until he\u0027d recovered do you know why he hadn\u0027t done so is does this report go into to detail about this as well well it\u0027s pretty clear that he didn\u0027t tell anybody about it and he didn\u0027t contact any of the pilots organizations that have been set up to provide sort of pit support for pilots who might be in this kind of condition another report speculates on not to suggest that one reason why he may not sort of like to the authorities to his own condition was because he was suffering possibly a psychosis which is a distancing from reality so he may not have been thinking clearly and not so but that was also a very strong financial motive for him to stay quiet because if he had alerted the authorities that he was suffering from depression that he was also incidently on anti depressant medicine and sleeping pills it\u0027s highly likely he would have been considered unfit to fly and would have been removed from duties now that would have hit his income he did have insurance to cover some of his debts which he\u0027d run up in his pilot training but he wouldn\u0027t of had any other means for carrying out his day to day life a great many people died on board both passengers and crew all that family saying anything about this report the families have all along been very critical of love Tanza the parent company of Germanwings saying that more should have been done potentially to provide support for the the pilot to weed out pilots who have potentially problematic mental conditions but on the other hand you have pilots unions who say that too much psychological screening could be a bad thing that pilots could be unnecessarily removed from duty while investigations occurring on and don\u0027t forget that Andreas lubitz wants regularly recessed his psychiatric condition was assessed the with the nose on his file that he had suffered depression very early in his career and on each occasion the era medical examiner decided that he was fit to fly and that was the BBC\u0027s their luggage but just how difficult is it for doctors to know when to alert authorities to a potential threat to public health and break patient confidentiality who has a question I put to professor Robert Bork consultant clinical psychologist who assesses the mental health of pilots as part of his job it reminded I\u0027ve ever worked with has always erred on the side of safety themselves they would rather not be working van in the Germanwings scenario with the person so to conceal their difficulties from others and office he to commit suicide in a work setting so that you know I mean it\u0027s an incredibly rare experience in aviation so for the very fast majority opined that we see it won\u0027t ever get to that point shouldn\u0027t be honest be on the doctors to think this person\u0027s condition has deteriorated and it\u0027s now a public safety issue absolutely and in fact that is always I think understood and it\u0027s about the world over with any pilot who goes to a doctor and that talk to feel you know whether it\u0027s visual impairment or some kind of mental problem that they could be some jeopardy to safety would act in in some way arm to ensure that that person was receiving the right treatment what appears to have happened here now that we have read reported that there was a failure of communication between the civilian doctors in Germany and I think what is important here is the the civilian doctors and not part of the aviation specialization and they\u0027re in Germany and we do understand that there is some confusion there among some doctors about that line where it is to be drawn and what the limits of confidentiality should be and that is the big lesson from this particular a report in other countries do you think that line is drawn sufficiently my understanding is that the line is actually very clear doctors don\u0027t like to breach confidentiality ever I think they will always do so very reluctantly but in weighing up the threat to our public harm that is something that is for most a lot more straightforward and in certain kinds Norway and Israel it is meant date tree for a civilian doctor who believes that the pilot maybe in some jeopardy or is likely to cause harm to the population but to and to break confidentiality and to report this they shouldn\u0027t invade mandates mean all countries I think it is understood to be that is the extent to which doctors will implement it I don\u0027t think that the laws need change to adjustment my understanding is that they need to be properly adhered to and that\u0027s what didn\u0027t happen in this particular case Hudson could hide some of the symptoms from doctors because they feel as though that career would be over if they showed certain symptoms which could and that Korea for that put probably happened in this case here the fear that he would lose his job prevented him from doing the most honest and all the thing that he should have done but there are other systems in place and other people who come to who we encounter who have you know act as a fullback so for example every time a policy that the controlled opiate copilot\u0027s observing them fights when they go out for a crew rest there is a dispatcher sometimes passengers and other crew members will also observed that parted so the likelihood of that happening is incredibly infrequent that we

vast majority of people we get our hero and also that I\u0027m so this is nothing which is itself also used for labor market which is focusing on highly educated article that was businessman story from the a FDC policy while David mouse\u0027s head of the official monetary and financial institutions forum I\u0027ll ask him if he was surprised by the results it is something of an earthquake if you simply look at it and statistical terms this is really the first time since the reverse of German democracy after the second World War that you\u0027ve had a right wing populist policies come to the surface in such a big way across a whole swathe of Germany novel party called a hefty present in a state parliaments and they came actually from New three states to state parliament time is certainly given charge of a medical something of a bloody nose in terms of showing but her policy on migration and is very very unpopular but in real terms in terms of what this means for her as a leader she can probably draw some comfort from is paradoxically enough because her coalition partners the Social Democratic Party they did very badly much person her party did so she is still the only woman standing here on the German political scene and the greens have also maze games haven\u0027t may taking over a rule controlled the regional parliament for the first time and they have supported Mrs Michael starts on migration as well haven\u0027t may is shows how fragmented the German scene is because the greens did very well in Baden Baden bag which one of the most wealthy parts of Germany very industrial so basically you wouldn\u0027t imagine the greens would do all that well created great well they\u0027re very badly and neighboring violent listening to showing regional sensibilities tradition that the country\u0027s very polarized a very fragmented but doesn\u0027t give one universal message this whole series of rather fragmentary messages and it could be that medical will draw some comfort from all this she is weakened but all her adversaries have also been ways and given that it seems politically the country\u0027s becoming so polarize it will be difficult romantic to try and draw some of those economic policies that set the rifles who make great gains have been trying to promote to the electorate ch it will be hard to draw those in well into an appeal to a wider base in future elections the ASD don\u0027t really have any policies on the economy close to the Europa Germany\u0027s in the year is gonna be favorite genesis came you\u0027re right we do know that the SeniorNet government in Berlin the one that Mrs Meg who is in charge of with a Christian Democrats they\u0027re going to have to take a more pragmatic live on austerity and basically over issues some of the budgetary targets anyway because of the huge amount of pressure on public spending caused by the influx of refugees so already the economic policy has changed and the facts are and they will be much less a finger wagging at the other European countries by Mrs medical and her friends in the government because they actually need some solidarity from the other country as well so I believe the true fixes may well be the government\u0027s involves and initially with Mr alongs understood principle that backs against the wall domestically they both need a bit of extra German understanding over their own budget stream problems and they may not get it because Michael is weaker and she needs friends abroad and those people in Paris and a roommate just turn out to be this friend and that was David mas head of the official monetary and financial institutions forum let\u0027s check in now with the financial markets and Jerry that stone call from Charleston is with me tell me you\u0027ve been watching the results of those elections with interest the European central banks Domenici policies very controversial in Japanese net I Hoces other yes it is Sir the Germans have historically feuds European central bank policy extreme skeptically particular course decisions take the overnight interest rates further into negative territory I actually happen to agree with quite a lot of what I heard in those reports that I thought that Sir it\u0027s fair to say the Serb wells miracles power base has been eroded so has thus of some of her major competitors but of course it\u0027s a CD you see S. U. coalition and I just since the alternative Deutschlands at this up and coming policy is rather like the National Front policy in Paris you know young firebrand leader the map of Europe that is changing a new generation of political leaders is beginning to emerge so I would not belittle this results and I think it would be a huge mistake the medical and her supporters to blisters this could be the start of something sticky with immigration of course going back on the radar screens we get the summer look at the wider market oil has dropped back again what\u0027s driving that I\u0027m well of following a real supportive comment from the I. E. A. on Friday evening we had opaque delivering a dose of reality late this afternoon OPEC arguing that due to weak global economic activity demand for oil is going to be very subdued and therefore there will be higher surplus as yet nothing has been done to address the difference between supply which is substantial and amount which is weak and of course nothing that any of the producers as saying at the moment lenses sell to any kind of agreement to cut output okay demi about sick of them tell Sonny many thanks the latest numbers for you the footsie one hundred thirty four points to sixty one seventy four and a New York the Dow Jones up thus it seventeen thousand two hundred and forty four you\u0027re listening to well business report from the BBC world service still to come it\u0027s now becoming Valga to boast about how long you walk shorts allies equal high status more from Lucy Callaway from the Financial Times coming up the pilots who flew the Germanwings Ashcroft into a French mountainside killing one hundred and fifty people on board was showing signs of psychosis that\u0027s among the findings of investigators who\u0027ve been prepping the causes of the crash a gimmick at twenty seven year old Andreas lubitz who was suffering from depression was allowed to continue flying despite having been seen by doctors dozens of times in the preceding days their votes called folk cables on the lifting of medical confidentiality of pilot show signs of psychological problems the BBC\u0027s their luggage was been following the story and he told me more about the findings pretty clear that the co pilot had a history of depressive illness and that\u0027s in the weeks before the accident he consulted a number of different doctors several of whom had issued medical certificate sunset nights exempt him from work one doctor had actually diagnosed a possible psychosis and recommended a hospitalization until he\u0027d recovered do you know why he hadn\u0027t done so is does this report go into to detail about this as well well it\u0027s pretty clear that he didn\u0027t tell anybody about it and he didn\u0027t contact any of the pilots organizations that have been set up to provide sort of pit support for pilots who might be in this kind of condition another report speculates on not to suggest that one reason why he may not sort of like to the authorities to his own condition was because he was suffering possibly a psychosis which is a distancing from reality so he may not have been thinking clearly and not so but that was also a very strong financial motive for him to stay quiet because if he had alerted the authorities that he was suffering from depression that he was also incidently on anti depressant medicine and sleeping pills it\u0027s highly likely he would have been considered unfit to fly and would have been removed from duties now that would have hit his income he did have insurance to cover some of his debts which he\u0027d run up in his pilot training but he wouldn\u0027t of had any other means for carrying out his day to day life a great many people died on board both passengers and crew all that family saying anything about this report the families have all along been very critical of love Tanza the parent company of Germanwings saying that more should have been done potentially to provide support for the the pilot to weed out pilots who have potentially problematic mental conditions but on the other hand you have pilots unions who say that too much psychological screening could be a bad thing that pilots could be unnecessarily removed from duty while investigations occurring on and don\u0027t forget that Andreas lubitz wants regularly recessed his psychiatric condition was assessed the with the nose on his file that he had suffered depression very early in his career and on each occasion the era medical examiner decided that he was fit to fly and that was the BBC\u0027s their luggage but just how difficult is it for doctors to know when to alert authorities to a potential threat to public health and break patient confidentiality who has a question I put to professor Robert Bork consultant clinical psychologist who assesses the mental health of pilots as part of his job it reminded I\u0027ve ever worked with has always erred on the side of safety themselves they would rather not be working van in the Germanwings scenario with the person so to conceal their difficulties from others and office he to commit suicide in a work setting so that you know I mean it\u0027s an incredibly rare experience in aviation so for the very fast majority opined that we see it won\u0027t ever get to that point shouldn\u0027t be honest be on the doctors to think this person\u0027s condition has deteriorated and it\u0027s now a public safety issue absolutely and in fact that is always I think understood and it\u0027s about the world over with any pilot who goes to a doctor and that talk to feel you know whether it\u0027s visual impairment or some kind of mental problem that they could be some jeopardy to safety would act in in some way arm to ensure that that person was receiving the right treatment what appears to have happened here now that we have read reported that there was a failure of communication between the civilian doctors in Germany and I think what is important here is the the civilian doctors and not part of the aviation specialization and they\u0027re in Germany and we do understand that there is some confusion there among some doctors about that line where it is to be drawn and what the limits of confidentiality should be and that is the big lesson from this particular a report in other countries do you think that line is drawn sufficiently my understanding is that the line is actually very clear doctors don\u0027t like to breach confidentiality ever I think they will always do so very reluctantly but in weighing up the threat to our public harm that is something that is for most a lot more straightforward and in certain kinds Norway and Israel it is meant date tree for a civilian doctor who believes that the pilot maybe in some jeopardy or is likely to cause harm to the population but to and to break confidentiality and to report this they shouldn\u0027t invade mandates mean all countries I think it is understood to be that is the extent to which doctors will implement it I don\u0027t think that the laws need change to adjustment my understanding is that they need to be properly adhered to and that\u0027s what didn\u0027t happen in this particular case Hudson could hide some of the symptoms from doctors because they feel as though that career would be over if they showed certain symptoms which could and that Korea for that put probably happened in this case here the fear that he would lose his job prevented him from doing the most honest and all the thing that he should have done but there are other systems in place and other people who come to who we encounter who have you know act as a fullback so for example every time a policy that the controlled opiate copilot\u0027s observing them fights when they go out for a crew rest there is a dispatcher sometimes passengers and other crew members will also observed that parted so the likelihood of that happening is incredibly infrequent that we look back in the last thirty years we understand that there probably being around six or seven pilot suicides and although everyone of that is completely unacceptable emphatically actual numbers that are involved here remains incredibly lows and so it is still a very safe system provided everybody exercising the right judgment and that was princess and wild boar consultant clinical psychologists stretching as far as the eye can see huge fields of solar panels have been switched on in South Africa to try and plug the country\u0027s electricity deficit just two weeks after George apple became the first on the continent to be powered by energy from the sun huge solar energy and storage plant opened today in the Northern Cape province it\u0027ll have one of the world\u0027s biggest solo Brady seller radiation footprints and promises to generate enough power for a course at the million homes day and tonight I spoke to the managing director of the plant none do Buddha and he\u0027d tell me more about how the technology works well they parabolic trough so they effectively concave couple of murders that reflect the sun\u0027s light onto a central troop this running along it so you have room fields of these concave mirrors that have achieved in it and we have HTF which is high temperature fluid that\u0027s flying through it and that is used as your eating fluid to eventually drive a steam turbine South Africa has really suffered with blackouts over recent years to what extent will this plug help plug the energy deficit well this is one of many plans that I actually supporting the south African grid and in particular Eskom as the sole provider of power in the country so that IPP programs been extremely successful in that we got pretty close to three thousand megawatts to the grid and providing relief to the though the current good ball utility so from that perspective yes this is the spot plays a huge role is also low class in the sense that it now has the thermal storage system and wished allows the plant to be not only a renewable generator but also a baseload continuous operator this push for renewables is being driven by the south African government but given the huge investment costs of this type of technology it could be in a fifteen twenty years before I feel actually pays for itself couldn\u0027t it wouldn\u0027t it be cheaper ready to invest in something that\u0027s not renewable at this current time was oil prices so depressed I think that\u0027s that\u0027s actually not quite true because of the price reduction in over the various bits process is that the south African government have put on the table we started of with around one bids with the IPP program which had quite high prices but if you look at the place will be outlawed now it round three going to run for the prices have really dive to a point where we are almost at parity with conventional power prices so the the conventional politicians don\u0027t have much on that rely on the renewable program right now on and the fact that we are now having see is people on that is becoming cost competitive with storage making them also despicable Powell plans they become extensively equally competitive even so South Africa is still pretty reliant on call how to try and persuade policy makers not just in South Africa but in other parts of the world rarely that this is the time to switch well I mean the the the issue here is to show success in projects like book work so the project like Bob would will of course ones running be able to be of a continuous operator and show the world that effectively assisted bloodwood storage can compete with conventional thumb about blogs the thing is that in other parts of the world it\u0027s to simply notice Sonny is South Africa they really still does need to be a mix of both the traditional technology is like coal and gas and renewables doesn\u0027t now no definitely I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s a good out there that needs to be solely solar I think solar can complement current technologies countries like South Africa have a benefit of a world of us resourcing in Colin Powell\u0027s so we must use that that is ninety percent of our current technology base however we are diversifying would bring in wind brilliancy SP and and other additional investment in nuclear put potentially so that I think it\u0027s you require div diverse mix it also spread your risk and to bring technology close to the ground so that at least we have different options to consider it depending on your your your atmospheric conditions and the mental resources that you have available I thought that was the MD at the plant and do Pula how are you listening to this in a car honking away through traffic head down with headphones in racing into work or are you attempting to do the dishes and cook dinner simultaneously while overseeing homework anyway however you\u0027re listening is it time perhaps for you to slow down a little Lucy Callaway the Financial Times thinks her explains why mostly because social event for senior bank because that was a discussion on what people were trying to give up almost everyone was trying to go a few weeks without alcohol about from one man he said he was trying to give up something much tougher he was trying to quit excessive walk not just for a few weeks but for the rest of his life he was fed up with pointless meetings and of emailing at eleven PM sisters in couple of weeks earlier he had achieved just as much as before but on average had worked no more than seven hours a day and spent the rest of his time enjoying himself that\u0027s nothing extraordinary about this it all makes perfect sense work expands to fill the time

he\u0027d run up in his pilot training but he wouldn\u0027t of had any other means for carrying out his day to day life a great many people died on board both passengers and crew all that family saying anything about this report the families have all along been very critical of love Tanza the parent company of Germanwings saying that more should have been done potentially to provide support for the the pilot to weed out pilots who have potentially problematic mental conditions but on the other hand you have pilots unions who say that too much psychological screening could be a bad thing that pilots could be unnecessarily removed from duty while investigations occurring on and don\u0027t forget that Andreas lubitz wants regularly recessed his psychiatric condition was assessed the with the nose on his file that he had suffered depression very early in his career and on each occasion the era medical examiner decided that he was fit to fly and that was the BBC\u0027s their luggage but just how difficult is it for doctors to know when to alert authorities to a potential threat to public health and break patient confidentiality who has a question I put to professor Robert Bork consultant clinical psychologist who assesses the mental health of pilots as part of his job it reminded I\u0027ve ever worked with has always erred on the side of safety themselves they would rather not be working van in the Germanwings scenario with the person so to conceal their difficulties from others and office he to commit suicide in a work setting so that you know I mean it\u0027s an incredibly rare experience in aviation so for the very fast majority opined that we see it won\u0027t ever get to that point shouldn\u0027t be honest be on the doctors to think this person\u0027s condition has deteriorated and it\u0027s now a public safety issue absolutely and in fact that is always I think understood and it\u0027s about the world over with any pilot who goes to a doctor and that talk to feel you know whether it\u0027s visual impairment or some kind of mental problem that they could be some jeopardy to safety would act in in some way arm to ensure that that person was receiving the right treatment what appears to have happened here now that we have read reported that there was a failure of communication between the civilian doctors in Germany and I think what is important here is the the civilian doctors and not part of the aviation specialization and they\u0027re in Germany and we do understand that there is some confusion there among some doctors about that line where it is to be drawn and what the limits of confidentiality should be and that is the big lesson from this particular a report in other countries do you think that line is drawn sufficiently my understanding is that the line is actually very clear doctors don\u0027t like to breach confidentiality ever I think they will always do so very reluctantly but in weighing up the threat to our public harm that is something that is for most a lot more straightforward and in certain kinds Norway and Israel it is meant date tree for a civilian doctor who believes that the pilot maybe in some jeopardy or is likely to cause harm to the population but to and to break confidentiality and to report this they shouldn\u0027t invade mandates mean all countries I think it is understood to be that is the extent to which doctors will implement it I don\u0027t think that the laws need change to adjustment my understanding is that they need to be properly adhered to and that\u0027s what didn\u0027t happen in this particular case Hudson could hide some of the symptoms from doctors because they feel as though that career would be over if they showed certain symptoms which could and that Korea for that put probably happened in this case here the fear that he would lose his job prevented him from doing the most honest and all the thing that he should have done but there are other systems in place and other people who come to who we encounter who have you know act as a fullback so for example every time a policy that the controlled opiate copilot\u0027s observing them fights when they go out for a crew rest there is a dispatcher sometimes passengers and other crew members will also observed that parted so the likelihood of that happening is incredibly infrequent that we look back in the last thirty years we understand that there probably being around six or seven pilot suicides and although everyone of that is completely unacceptable emphatically actual numbers that are involved here remains incredibly lows and so it is still a very safe system provided everybody exercising the right judgment and that was princess and wild boar consultant clinical psychologists stretching as far as the eye can see huge fields of solar panels have been switched on in South Africa to try and plug the country\u0027s electricity deficit just two weeks after George apple became the first on the continent to be powered by energy from the sun huge solar energy and storage plant opened today in the Northern Cape province it\u0027ll have one of the world\u0027s biggest solo Brady seller radiation footprints and promises to generate enough power for a course at the million homes day and tonight I spoke to the managing director of the plant none do Buddha and he\u0027d tell me more about how the technology works well they parabolic trough so they effectively concave couple of murders that reflect the sun\u0027s light onto a central troop this running along it so you have room fields of these concave mirrors that have achieved in it and we have HTF which is high temperature fluid that\u0027s flying through it and that is used as your eating fluid to eventually drive a steam turbine South Africa has really suffered with blackouts over recent years to what extent will this plug help plug the energy deficit well this is one of many plans that I actually supporting the south African grid and in particular Eskom as the sole provider of power in the country so that IPP programs been extremely successful in that we got pretty close to three thousand megawatts to the grid and providing relief to the though the current good ball utility so from that perspective yes this is the spot plays a huge role is also low class in the sense that it now has the thermal storage system and wished allows the plant to be not only a renewable generator but also a baseload continuous operator this push for renewables is being driven by the south African government but given the huge investment costs of this type of technology it could be in a fifteen twenty years before I feel actually pays for itself couldn\u0027t it wouldn\u0027t it be cheaper ready to invest in something that\u0027s not renewable at this current time was oil prices so depressed I think that\u0027s that\u0027s actually not quite true because of the price reduction in over the various bits process is that the south African government have put on the table we started of with around one bids with the IPP program which had quite high prices but if you look at the place will be outlawed now it round three going to run for the prices have really dive to a point where we are almost at parity with conventional power prices so the the conventional politicians don\u0027t have much on that rely on the renewable program right now on and the fact that we are now having see is people on that is becoming cost competitive with storage making them also despicable Powell plans they become extensively equally competitive even so South Africa is still pretty reliant on call how to try and persuade policy makers not just in South Africa but in other parts of the world rarely that this is the time to switch well I mean the the the issue here is to show success in projects like book work so the project like Bob would will of course ones running be able to be of a continuous operator and show the world that effectively assisted bloodwood storage can compete with conventional thumb about blogs the thing is that in other parts of the world it\u0027s to simply notice Sonny is South Africa they really still does need to be a mix of both the traditional technology is like coal and gas and renewables doesn\u0027t now no definitely I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s a good out there that needs to be solely solar I think solar can complement current technologies countries like South Africa have a benefit of a world of us resourcing in Colin Powell\u0027s so we must use that that is ninety percent of our current technology base however we are diversifying would bring in wind brilliancy SP and and other additional investment in nuclear put potentially so that I think it\u0027s you require div diverse mix it also spread your risk and to bring technology close to the ground so that at least we have different options to consider it depending on your your your atmospheric conditions and the mental resources that you have available I thought that was the MD at the plant and do Pula how are you listening to this in a car honking away through traffic head down with headphones in racing into work or are you attempting to do the dishes and cook dinner simultaneously while overseeing homework anyway however you\u0027re listening is it time perhaps for you to slow down a little Lucy Callaway the Financial Times thinks her explains why mostly because social event for senior bank because that was a discussion on what people were trying to give up almost everyone was trying to go a few weeks without alcohol about from one man he said he was trying to give up something much tougher he was trying to quit excessive walk not just for a few weeks but for the rest of his life he was fed up with pointless meetings and of emailing at eleven PM sisters in couple of weeks earlier he had achieved just as much as before but on average had worked no more than seven hours a day and spent the rest of his time enjoying himself that\u0027s nothing extraordinary about this it all makes perfect sense work expands to fill the time available and all that and this man was senior enough to dictate his own schedule but the reason I make so much of this story is that for the past two decades overpaid professionals have been not just working around the clock but boasting about it to get here was someone at the top of a competitive workaholic industry trying to make himself seem even bigger in the eyes of his pairs not by saying how much she was but how little it\u0027s possible that this is the beginning of something big Bucks and Russell and John may not Keynes both predicted this in the nineteen thirties it\u0027s been a long time coming but maybe it\u0027s happening lost she told me that in and lead to executive circles in the U. S. things are beginning to change justice it\u0027s vulgar to post about how much you consume it\u0027s now becoming Valga to boast about how long you walk is a vanguard of people she claimed who is starting to make the sort of post my banker was making shorts allies equal high status at the time I like to have very but saw no signs of it being true instead what I saw were the friends of my children starting out in consulting on the Lowell not only did they seem to work longer hours than ever they look down on anyone who left work at six PM but now I\u0027m wondering if half and I might be right self rule for years employers in Sweden a country that was never a fan of either working have been experimenting with a six hour day there are signs that workaholic Anglo Saxons are looking on with approval rather than superiority the independent newspapers just run an online poll asking whether a similar experiment impression would make after a more productive about ninety five percent said it would as my bank has bug I studied the faces of the water swelling man he was addressing one snorted and said good luck with that but the other four item with what looked like resentment laced with pure envy and other words his boast worked magnificently our correspondent for the Financial Times via some breaking news now on the BBC Russian president Vladimir Putin has ordered the military to withdraw the main part of the forces in Syria saying they had largely achieved that goals the Palat will start on Tuesday more coming up from BBC news on that but thanks for listening to wealth business reports from all of us here good bye there are many ways to keep up with the BBC world service join us on social media or sign of a pot costs and BBC world service dot com slash part because",

at the very moment because all the other parties which a running do not focus on what is in the concerns of the people and of course we had a huge debate about migration which is all the case all over here Europe and we have a god who is going very very key line on the migration issue I we want to because of August and we said that we can\u0027t take more refugees focusing on the economy projections show that Germany needs an or for loss of migration for it to really function in the coming decades im pay for all the pensions for example of those taxes need days surely these refugees could really help plug that gap over what some people say that that they start to realize that people coming to us but not the kind of migrants we need what we need is highly educated people and what we see is that those people coming to earth in the vast majority not highly educated and not not able to be highly educated so what we need is labor force and what we get is migrants which we did not

pool regional election results for her conservative Christian Democrats policy significant gains by the anti immigrant AFT policy at the expense of the CD you have been put down to discontent with Mrs knuckles open door policy on migration speaking at a news conference in Berlin she acknowledge that frustration about immigration was one of the reasons for the poll result but set that would be no change in policy es mas oud ourselves artist community models predicting the dominating topic was the refugee policy the fact that in the view of the people there is nice truancy a significant influence on the result of the election I strongly believe and this wasn\u0027t question today that we need a European solution but there is no sustainable solution yet over four hundred how stunts on migrants has been backed by the leader of the Green Party which also made significant gains in Baden Baden but the greens became the biggest policy in a regional parliament for the first time so it begins on the left and also to the far right it\u0027s clear that many voters want to change to the status quo so what could that mean for economic policy and a country considered to be the powerhouse of Europe well first of all aspects of the general secretary of the Green Party in Germany Michael Kellner Walser historic success what\u0027s that the first time ever in German history that the Green Party came out strongest party in one of the major land that in Germany in Barton looking back really you\u0027ve successfully now one reason this movie our front runner vin Creta Kretschmann he did a marvelous campaign what is you\u0027ll economic policy that you communicated to voters in a way regretful that and in a state where strong German industries spotlight congresses in the way that we want Saddam as green so the green to future we not thinking to get high environmental issues and economic issues and death wanna kind of agreeing transformation also wealth in he\u0027s in a way told a story that that in green ideas allies to future also hoodlum industries you policy leader has also been supportive of Angola miracles policy on migrants do you see migrants is the future for Germany in the numbers that they have and took the country Germany meets migrations buckets also a quite a challenge to cope with want peace large numbers of of refugees in Germany we need you clean solution to these questions source of it was a very pro European approach this in the campaign and this was clearly that we support argued a miracle and in her way to find the you Michael cannon that\u0027s on the Green Party in Germany leather tricks when destroys the MEP of the anti immigration a hefty policy I asked her why she thought how close he had made such significant gains we have such a success at the very moment because all the other parties which a running do not focus on what is in the concerns of the people and of course we had a huge debate about migration which is all the case all over here Europe and we have a god who is going very very key line on the migration issue I we want to because of August and we said that we can\u0027t take more refugees focusing on the economy projections show that Germany needs an or for loss of migration for it to really function in the coming decades im pay for all the pensions for example of those taxes need days surely these refugees could really help plug that gap over what some people say that that they start to realize that people coming to us but not the kind of migrants we need what we need is highly educated people and what we see is that those people coming to earth in the vast majority not highly educated and not not able to be highly educated so what we need is labor force and what we get is migrants which we did not choose that many of those people coming from Syria are highly educated record this is just one of those talks which is just not true and it doesn\u0027t get more troops and more often you repeated the vast majority of people we get our hero and also that I\u0027m so this is nothing which is itself also used for labor market which is focusing on highly educated article that was businessman story from the a FDC policy while David mouse\u0027s head of the official monetary and financial institutions forum I\u0027ll ask him if he was surprised by the results it is something of an earthquake if you simply look at it and statistical terms this is really the first time since the reverse of German democracy after the second World War that you\u0027ve had a right wing populist policies come to the surface in such a big way across a whole swathe of Germany novel party called a hefty present in a state parliaments and they came actually from New three states to state parliament time is certainly given charge of a medical something of a bloody nose in terms of showing but her policy on migration and is very very unpopular but in real terms in terms of what this means for her as a leader she can probably draw some comfort from is paradoxically enough because her coalition partners the Social Democratic Party they did very badly much person her party did so she is still the only woman standing here on the German political scene and the greens have also maze games haven\u0027t may taking over a rule controlled the regional parliament for the first time and they have supported Mrs Michael starts on migration as well haven\u0027t may is shows how fragmented the German scene is because the greens did very well in Baden Baden bag which one of the most wealthy parts of Germany very industrial so basically you wouldn\u0027t imagine the greens would do all that well created great well they\u0027re very badly and neighboring violent listening to showing regional sensibilities tradition that the country\u0027s very polarized a very fragmented but doesn\u0027t give one universal message this whole series of rather fragmentary messages and it could be that medical will draw some comfort from all this she is weakened but all her adversaries have also been ways and given that it seems politically the country\u0027s becoming so polarize it will be difficult romantic to try and draw some of those economic policies that set the rifles who make great gains have been trying to promote to the electorate ch it will be hard to draw those in well into an appeal to a wider base in future elections the ASD don\u0027t really have any policies on the economy close to the Europa Germany\u0027s in the year is gonna be favorite genesis came you\u0027re right we do know that the SeniorNet government in Berlin the one that Mrs Meg who is in charge of with a Christian Democrats they\u0027re going to have to take a more pragmatic live on austerity and basically over issues some of the budgetary targets anyway because of the huge amount of pressure on public spending caused by the influx of refugees so already the economic policy has changed and the facts are and they will be much less a finger wagging at the other European countries by Mrs medical and her friends in the government because they actually need some solidarity from the other country as well so I believe the true fixes may well be the government\u0027s involves and initially with Mr alongs understood principle that backs against the wall domestically they both need a bit of extra German understanding over their own budget stream problems and they may not get it because Michael is weaker and she needs friends abroad and those people in Paris and a roommate just turn out to be this friend and that was David mas head of the official monetary and financial institutions forum let\u0027s check in now with the financial markets and Jerry that stone call from Charleston is with me tell me you\u0027ve been watching the results of those elections with interest the European central banks Domenici policies very controversial in Japanese net I Hoces other yes it is Sir the Germans have historically feuds European central bank policy extreme skeptically particular course decisions take the overnight interest rates further into negative territory I actually happen to agree with quite a lot of what I heard in those reports that I thought that Sir it\u0027s fair to say the Serb wells miracles power base has been eroded so has thus of some of her major competitors but of course it\u0027s a CD you see S. U. coalition and I just since the alternative Deutschlands at this up and coming policy is rather like the National Front policy in Paris you know young firebrand leader the map of Europe that is changing a new generation of political leaders is beginning to emerge so I would not belittle this results and I think it would be a huge mistake the medical and her supporters to blisters this could be the start of something sticky with immigration of course going back on the radar screens we get the summer look at the wider market oil has dropped back again what\u0027s driving that I\u0027m well of following a real supportive comment from the I. E. A. on Friday evening we had opaque delivering a dose of reality late this afternoon OPEC arguing that due to weak global economic activity demand for oil is going to be very subdued and therefore there will be higher surplus as yet nothing has been done to address the difference between supply which is substantial and amount which is weak and of course nothing that any of the producers as saying at the moment lenses sell to any kind of agreement to cut output okay demi about sick of them tell Sonny many thanks the latest numbers for you the footsie one hundred thirty four points to sixty one seventy four and a New York the Dow Jones up thus it seventeen thousand two hundred and forty four you\u0027re listening to well business report from the BBC world service still to come it\u0027s now becoming Valga to boast about how long you walk shorts allies equal high status more from Lucy Callaway from the Financial Times coming up the pilots who flew the Germanwings Ashcroft into a French mountainside killing one hundred and fifty people on board was showing signs of psychosis that\u0027s among the findings of investigators who\u0027ve been prepping the causes of the crash a gimmick at twenty seven year old Andreas lubitz who was suffering from depression was allowed to continue flying despite having been seen by doctors dozens of times in the preceding days their votes called folk cables on the lifting of medical confidentiality of pilot show signs of psychological problems the BBC\u0027s their luggage was been following the story and he told me more about the findings pretty clear that the co pilot had a history of depressive illness and that\u0027s in the weeks before the accident he consulted a number of different doctors several of whom had issued medical certificate sunset nights exempt him from work one doctor had actually diagnosed a possible psychosis and recommended a hospitalization until he\u0027d recovered do you know why he hadn\u0027t done so is does this report go into to detail about this as well well it\u0027s pretty clear that he didn\u0027t tell anybody about it and he didn\u0027t contact any of the pilots organizations that have been set up to provide sort of pit support for pilots who might be in this kind of condition another report speculates on not to suggest that one reason why he may not sort of like to the authorities to his own condition was because he was suffering possibly a psychosis which is a distancing from reality so he may not have been thinking clearly and not so but that was also a very strong financial motive for him to stay quiet because if he had alerted the authorities that he was suffering from depression that he was also incidently on anti depressant medicine and sleeping pills it\u0027s highly likely he would have been considered unfit to fly and would have been removed from duties now that would have hit his income he did have insurance to cover some of his debts which he\u0027d run up in his pilot training but he wouldn\u0027t of had any other means for carrying out his day to day life a great many people died on board both passengers and crew all that family saying anything about this report the families have all along been very critical of love Tanza the parent company of Germanwings saying that more should have been done potentially to provide support for the the pilot to weed out pilots who have potentially problematic mental conditions but on the other hand you have pilots unions who say that too much psychological screening could be a bad thing that pilots could be unnecessarily removed from duty while investigations occurring on and don\u0027t forget that Andreas lubitz wants regularly recessed his psychiatric condition was assessed the with the nose on his file that he had suffered depression very early in his career and on each occasion the era medical examiner decided that he was fit to fly and that was the BBC\u0027s their luggage but just how difficult is it for doctors to know when to alert authorities to a potential threat to public health and break patient confidentiality who has a question I put to professor Robert Bork consultant clinical psychologist who assesses the mental health of pilots as part of his job it reminded I\u0027ve ever worked with has always erred on the side of safety themselves they would rather not be working van in the Germanwings scenario with the person so to conceal their difficulties from others and office he to commit suicide in a work setting so that you know I mean it\u0027s an incredibly rare experience in aviation so for the very fast majority opined that we see it won\u0027t ever get to that point shouldn\u0027t be honest be on the doctors to think this person\u0027s

    "text": "this is world business report from the BBC world service I\u0027m Susanna\u0027s Theresa five years on have lessons being learned from the Fukushima nuclear disaster sometimes good things come from bad things and my hope is that Fukushima will change the way nuclear power plants are run around the world untangling the law in the event of break says companies Mull over the legal implications of Britain leaving the year you have to remember we\u0027ve spent forty years as part of the European union and the full forty years harmonizing our two legal system so if he\u0027s going to be a very complex process and the latest twist in the cyber heist at the New York federal reserve one of the hackers mis typed a word and say right foundations of foundation at that point discovery was made that the money was going to sources that were not verified that\u0027s all coming up but fast uhhuh dnmt nndb remembering the victims of the devastating prime minister Shinzo Abby that the ceremony in Tokyo hit not the moment five years ago when the huge trauma unleashed a torrent of wolves which devastated Japan\u0027s northeast coast eighteen thousand people died in today more than a hundred and seventy thousand people still remain in temporary accommodation the tsunami also crippled a nuclear plant kushina web meltdowns in three reactors spread radiation over a wide area contamination Borsa whose and at well because from the energy company tapco observed a minute\u0027s silence the plot the company\u0027s president Sammy carols told them it would not forget how its own safety procedures being at fault not meeting up there it\u0027s all going to be no I don\u0027t think it\u0027s an exaggeration to say that the tsunami smashed and swept away the over confidence and arrogance technical today five years on we need to face that fact once again and I would like to reaffirm his determination with you that we take responsibility for the Fukushima accident and that\u0027s ok though organist at the moment well during the disaster safety systems at the Fukushima plant when knocks out and radioactive material was released into the air and into the state it was the worst nuclear accident in a quarter of a century and indeed one of the worst in history so what lasting effect has it had on the nuclear power industry a correspondent Thier legates has been finding out after the earthquake and tsunami Japan now has to cope with the big explosion at a nuclear power station the Japanese government has warned of a possible nuclear meltdown in another reactor as an art I believe that there is a possibility that Milton has occurred it is inside the reactor we all already products are actually uncovered the emanation raise review it shouldn\u0027t have happened but it did the Fukushima Daiichi plant was designed to withstand a severe earthquake and when it struck the reactors did indeed shut down safely but they still needed cooling and then came the fourteen needs a tsunami which engulfed the clan to knock out it\u0027s cooling systems the reactor cores overheated and melted and explosions and radioactive material spewing into the air five years later more than a thousand square kilometers of land around the plant remain off limits according to professor Toshiya Tsuda of Akiyama university that being serious health effects especially among young people was a mark and I no onto Littlejohn sludgy New York and Google thing on the thyroid cancer recurrence rates among Fukushima residents who are up to eighteen years of age in the year of the meltdown twenty to fifty times higher than those in other parts of Japan even within Fukushima prefecture the rates vary from place to place the closer location is to the dock she plans the higher the cancer Karen\u0027s got sky total orbital or confiscate will I mean the disaster crippled Japan\u0027s nuclear industry prior to the accident it had fifty four reactors available producing a third of the country\u0027s electricity or was shut down for safety checks and only a handful have since been restarted but the effects haven\u0027t just been felt in Japan as Barbara judge a former head of the U. K.\u0027s atomic energy authority and an adviser to the Fukushima plant undetected explains there was going to be a nuclear renaissance in Europe and not only faucet here in the UK but the Italians and the Germans and the Polish and the Hungarians and a whole bunch of European countries for building or renewing their power plants a lot of those countries of pull back from that off difficult shimmer Germany and Switzerland decided to phase out nuclear power altogether even fronts which relies on reactors for three quarters of its electricity has seen its industry suffer because its once thriving export markets have dried up but some experts believe the seeds of this decline were actually sign a quarter of a century the full Fukushima the Soviet Union has admitted that an accident has taken place at a nuclear power station turn a beer in the Ukraine Soviet authorities are telling the world very little about what is happening there but it\u0027s clear that a disaster of major proportions has occurred main television use hair analysis two people were killed in the nuclear accident the structure itself was destroyed and the wall speak of reasonable disaster of nineteen eighty six showed just how devastating a nuclear acts could be a radioactive plume contaminated a huge swathe of Europe from Ukraine to Scandinavia according to energy consultant Michael Snyder who opposes nuclear power memories of the accident a shaping attitudes to the industry to this day people forget but that in the UK you had you know sheep farmers that were under restriction orders until two thousand twelve from an accident fifteen hundred kilometers further distance so that left a very profound impression on the European population but although there\u0027s relatively little enthusiasm for nuclear power in Europe and North America in other regions it has much stronger support as Peter cannon lead energy analyst at the economist intelligence unit\u0027s explains the outlook for nuclear power is quite good especially in China and also in South Korea India and Russia that\u0027s money because they raise very fast growth in electricity consumption so these countries need to satisfy that increasing demand for power anyway they can and they\u0027ll say see nuclear power as a viable like carbon option but in the end the long term success or failure of the nuclear industry may come down to simple economics the costs of building reactors insuring safety dealing with waste and decommissioning redundant facilities are very high while generating electricity from gas is currently a lot cheaper and ultimately that may prove to be a bigger obstacle to the growth of nuclear power than the legacy the Fukushima when the elegance of course you had briefly from lady Robert judge the former head of the U. case atomic energy authority and an adviser to the board up tempo I interviewed her analyst washing her view was the long term scale of the damage to human health and the environment from the crew Fukushima disaster anybody who says they really know anything about anything it\u0027s probably wrong or at least know everything I believe that what\u0027s happening in Fukushima now is in the very best and brightest direction I believe that there is a handle on the decommissioning process the government and telco and the other big Japanese companies have banded together to provide the best decommissioning the most modern in do they have to keep inventing things to deal with cleaning up Fukushima with respect to the radiation actually if you talk to doctors I brought a woman named Jerry Thomas whose radiation specialists from imperial college I brought her to go to Fukushima to see what was going on there and from the radiation specialists they all believe that that actually Fukushima when it\u0027s cleaned up will be fine it\u0027s just like any of the other decommission plans that wheat with ridiculously Haro right here the fact is it\u0027s taken a long time but they\u0027re on the right road now there a lot of foreign experts coming in to help the Japanese into the whole world a nuclear community is focused on making sure the best possibly can be done to Fukushima will be and my own opinion I think we we will at this point find that the radiation damage is whatever there was and remember nobody die from radiation in Fukushima they certainly were problems in moving the people away from it but not actual radiation I think at this point it\u0027s on the very right wrote but efforts and money and training and time will continue to be needed for a long time so what lessons have been learned to think a lot a lot of lessons have been learned from Fukushima first of all what\u0027s learned is that every nuclear power plant needs a safety culture a very strong safety felt every nuclear power plant needs an independent regulator and there has to be a regulatory tension the regulator can\u0027t be too friendly with the operators they have to feel that there\u0027s a real when I call regulatory attention there has to be continual checks of what the equipment\u0027s doing people have to think the unthinkable left I mean in terms of Fukushima member twenty thousand people died from the earthquake but the power plants stayed up after the earthquake it was the tsunami that came and knocked out the back up systems which turned out the lights which meant everybody was operating in the dark and then there was actually no system of crisis control at the time today we know that when there\u0027s a crisis one person in the plant makes the decision I think that sometimes it\u0027s horrible to service but sometimes good things come from bad things you know in my opinion the whole world has learned a lot of lesson about the operation of nuclear power plants I was an SEC commissioner yes he was set up because we had the terrible depression in nineteen twenty nine in the stock market crash in America and a lot stock market crashes because they were really bad dealings going on in the markets thats why they set up the SEC the FCC has made the American markets wide and deep for many years regulation in the city of London really started with Maxwell crisis Maxwell was not a gentleman like the London people who\u0027d been in the city before thoughts when good regulation started lots of things that are really unfortunate end up having some good consequences and my hope is the Fukushima will change the way nuclear power plants are run around the world lady Barbara judge that two heavyweight British political figures of wages into the debate today about whether Britain should leave the European Union has first major speech since openly backing brexit London map hours Johnson has that leaving the EU is a win win claiming the UK could thrive and prosper as never before but the former prime minister Tony Blair told campaign it\u0027s for Britain to stay in the European Union to make the case with passion saying it\u0027s the UK\u0027s destiny to lead in Europe away from the sound bites on the campaign trail businesses large and small contemplating two very different futures both with uncertainty attached one huge question a grappling with is just how difficult it might be to unpack legislation which originates from Europe but is now enshrined in you can\u0027t know David hall is a partner from the international November just Hammond who advises corporate firms on domestic and international disputes he told me that it would not be easy you have to remember we spent forty years as part of the European Union Honda for forty years harmonizing our two legal systems under the laws that we have and so if he\u0027s going to be a very complex process to do that will work on various levels of the first things will have to do is that the big thing of having given notice to come out of the European you we will have to negotiate the continued relationship and integration between our legal system because just because we **** three European Union doesn\u0027t mean that we don\u0027t have a need to understand with our close trading partners how altitude ecosystems would work together this huge raft of peer legislation that ready governs how the UK operates there\u0027s a difference that was in that between European regulations and European directives yes strikes a regulation is something which has a direct effect into English school what that means is that we don\u0027t need any further English as a selection to make it have affect in the UK a directive however is a pronouncement all of the things that the European Union wants the the member states to bring into effect on their own who\u0027ll say if there was to be a brexit regulations would essentially disappear overnight we would remove ourselves from those and presumably we would then have to work out which of those actually really all the wounds it and so to workout how we keep the benefit of those regulations and remove those we don\u0027t want directives however a little complicated in that they are actually part of UK law and say that was lost would remain and if we didn\u0027t like those pits the legislature would have to workout how it Worsley Xie\u0027s those from the UK statute book sellers of what the lawyers huge outlook brother Moore with politicians and government put on them and massive button on the government to workout how and what needed to stay I\u0027m what would be to be brought in to replace that which it conference I\u0027ve got a regulation which is supervised by a body in the new adult body would no longer have jurisdiction to supervise those issues in England so we would have to therefore establish a replacement multi to to look at those things to what extent with this course at a huge headache for big corporations that you already advice yes well it is a it is a headache business thrives on certainty I work comes the long this is one way one to her certainly the rules that govern them in the outcomes of those rules and then they won\u0027t have certainty is what will happen if they have a speeds on those rules will they have a a quick and efficient and predictable outcome which they can then enforce top of the to do list will of course be renegotiating those trade agreements but how long could that tape why I think that he\u0027s probably the most important beta ultimately the Amy was established for many reasons but for free trade that has been established if we all now voting to remove ourselves from big free trade area we will have to negotiate how is that we can access that territory to address things like tariffs and non tariff based barriers to trade like licensing squashes quantity and that was David ho from budget fan it\u0027s time now to take a look at the financial markets and we can speak to bank him off seven investment management hello that bags of the markets is still digesting that move by the European central bank to cut key interest rates and flood the market with more liquidity yes it\u0027s it was a bit of a weird one ready now we know yesterday the markets initially rallied strongly on that fell again by the end of the day talking in particular about Europe now today the applicant very strongly taking most of the rest of the world with the so it seems that initially we thought this is everything we\u0027ve asked for and on further reflection people in the markets thought well we\u0027re not quite sure on the details after night digesting the details it seems that in fact Mr trophy house delivered the kind of stimulus that everybody wanted so pretty buoyant ready for the markets overall would you say yeah I think so European banks reps exit off percent today Europe the rest of Europe is up about three and a half percent it what Mr Draghi has really done is make sure the lending in the eurozone is that was easy as possible for banks to get on board with and he hasn\u0027t hurt the interest margin profit margins assistance okay thank you very much Ben Kimmel of seven investments management let me give you some of the latest numbers now from the financial markets and in London the one hundred Sharon Texas up one point seven percent at sixty one forty in New York the Dow is up one point three percent at seventeen thousand two hundred and ten gold is trading at one thousand two hundred and fifty nine dollars an ounce on the currency markets the gear I was at one dollar eleven point eight U. S. sense the pound is that one dollar forty four point one and April New York light crude oil is cut me up eighty three cents at fifty eight point six seven dollars a barrel it\u0027s that time of the week now when we can look back at just some of the stories which it made the headlines yeah nnat European central bank has announced new measures to boost the flagging eurozone economy further below zero makes the business models all bonds and insurance unsustainable in carts savers it is unclear died will promote five there are spending stop trump the Republican campaign to derail the property billionaires tilt for the White House the Republican Party as we have understood it free trade polite iffy wasabi party will never be the same if trump is the nominee the central bank in Bangladesh says the packets of stolen and unspecified amount of money from its account at the New York federal reserve we haven\u0027t gotten to the bottom of the story all the New York fed is saying is that their systems have not been breached that\u0027s doesn\u0027t mean there couldn\u0027t there hacking from China or somewhere else nnj so did you stop them well as we heard just now in the markets the European central bank has fought off a ministry policy bazooka but just how long will the effects last plus the presidential primary debates in the U. S. protectionism has read it has what would high tariff barriers mean for the American economy and the cyber heist at the New York federal reserve when he did those missing millions go wild to discuss those subjects I speak to Elaine more who\u0027s the capital markets correspondent at the Financial Times and London that\u0027ll say with Joan bus eight associate editor of the wallstreet journal in New York it warmed markets around the world initially and I think markets began to reflect on the deployment of the bazooka and the continuing concern that a previous fires from various armaments bi drugih I have not ignited the economy in Europe at a certain point psychology says this is an extraordinary measure set of measures that he has taken all stimulative wow this is going to really fire up things in Europe then psychology shifts and says but he must be feeling truly desperate at this stage how bad is it are we underestimating how bad it is LA more is that your take on this and do you think by Draghi signifying that they won\u0027t be further cuts that kinda have led to a bit more of a lukewarm reception definitely Sarah trader that I speak to quite regularly said that there was a hush that descended across the floor as soon as Mary drug made that statement about not investing further cuts being made up to that point markets have been rallying so the the stimulus of a program that married Jackie had announced was far more than anyone had been expecting some of the economist I was speaking to you today now that the dust to settle that has said perhaps my doggy is actually trying to influence the real economy so have to think that what they all said it was cut the rate at which banks in Europe Campari money from the ECB so perhaps the focus this time is not on the financial markets but on trying to get the real economy in Europe going how are negative rates views in the United States negatively Europe now joins the gallery of economic rogues and include Japan this is not good company Japan\u0027s had Skinner twenty years of economic stagnation viewed as kind of a hail Mary pass an effort to move an economy that has not responded to previous monetary policy and it reminds everybody that there\u0027s a lot of structural dislocation of the European economy that needs to be addressed and has not been and if you\u0027re a saver etcetera because them to rush out and take that money out of a can spend which would be stimulative it\u0027s going to cause them to hunker down even further it\u0027s going to cause them to save some concerns raised about policy in Europe but wash about policy puts on the table in the United States John at the presidential primaries protectionism is Brady bread ring it\u0027s had isn\u0027t it it really is it\u0027s wild and woolly and unpredictable what\u0027s happening in the American political campaign right now you have Donald Trump the front runner in the Republican contest for the nomination to be president talking about putting up forty five percent tariffs on China if it doesn\u0027t behave now what is what is he mean by that and how specific has he been way hazmat specifically we don\u0027t know what he means but it is highly protective and it\u0027s usually language that you find not on the right but on the left in politics in the United States and yesterday a rich Trumka who\u0027s head of the AFL CIO the union of unions said of trump you know even a blind squirrel can find an acorn now and again meaning that he was aligned with trump on his trade policy which is a very unusual in American politics and Elaine on the left it certainly seems now is that Hillary Clinton is playing catch up with Betty Saunders he\u0027s Hadda already anti free trade campaign so far it\u0027s really interesting the bunnies on as it\u0027s been able to use the idea of global trade is something to to hit Hillary Clinton within the fact that she\u0027s retreated from her support of the trans Pacific partnership which is heralded as this pivot that U. S. was going to do towards Asia but I think that it does make sense in this point in the elections that the focus is on the domestic economy there\u0027s a lot of concerns about the living standard of middle class Americans fatty sort of stagnating and the impact on jobs of global trade the concern for the rest of the world is that the IMF is been saying recently global trade is slowing down and it\u0027s a problem and that they won\u0027t policymakers to get involved and the U. S. just when people right now Elaine is absolutely right I mean this is catering to a deep concern of the United States that living standards have not been rising for a vast stretch of the electorate odd that has seen their jobs move abroad up or has just been disrupted by the digital economy however it does have an effect on the global economic outlook if the world is looking at negative interest rates in Japan negative interest rates in Europe stagnating economies in both any United States that might be retrenching to its own shores a politically and even if some of that language results in actual policy you\u0027ll see further slowdown globally in the economy what about the story about the New York federal reserve and this type a heist which Bangladesh claims is coal states more than a hundred million dollars because he said he seemed early on in the week because they need the site was talking the same story this looks as if it was a hack through the Bangladesh system hackers came in they got passwords they got authorization keys that allow them to behave as if they were the Bangladesh central bank and they moved money out of the federal reserve to other places around the world where they cashed it in so it looks like it came in through Bangladesh but even if it did this raises incredible questions about security of big money flows in the world how was that allowed to happen how was the fed not on top of Bangladesh saying your systems are inadequate how was the the fed not able to verify transactions of that size with central authorities in Bangladesh before they were made this is going to have a lot of repercussions because the money was of such a large amount the point that I think is really incredible is the way that this was found out so it wasn\u0027t that either of the central banks was able to spot this it was that one of the hackers mis typed a word and so right foundations and a foundation at that point discovery was made that the money was going to sources that were not verified it\u0027s a huge scale of a problem that is happening all over the world right now so I was talking to somebody who said that slot twelve thousand businesses worldwide are estimated to have been hacked by these things with a C. E. O. emails criminals a thought have got about two billion dollars from this you would expect would you John that systems at the New York federal reserve would\u0027ve been good enough to withstand the as you would expect and I think that of the good work of our colleagues in Europe on reporting this is going to result in a lot of review of how this happened because of it happened for Bangladesh one wonders who else has it happened for in other words not cannot happen again or will it happen again but where has it already happened that we just don\u0027t know this just goes to show that biggest intuitions big financial institutions are not impervious two what is it and credible global scourge at this point and that was John Makdessi associate editor of the wallstreet journal in New York and in that discussion with and they know who\u0027s capsule markets correspondent at the Financial Times in London that\u0027s all for this edition of world business report you can keep in touch by email well don\u0027t business at BBC dot co dot UK or on Twitter BBC world base from all of us here thank you for downloading from the BBC world service you can find a whole world of information from science arts business and technology just go to the BBC world service dot com slash pub because ",

K.\u0027s atomic energy authority and an adviser to the Fukushima plant undetected explains there was going to be a nuclear renaissance in Europe and not only faucet here in the UK but the Italians and the Germans and the Polish and the Hungarians and a whole bunch of European countries for building or renewing their power plants a lot of those countries of pull back from that off difficult shimmer Germany and Switzerland decided to phase out nuclear power altogether even fronts which relies on reactors for three quarters of its electricity has seen its industry suffer because its once thriving export markets have dried up but some experts believe the seeds of this decline were actually sign a quarter of a century the full Fukushima the Soviet Union has admitted that an accident has taken place at a nuclear power station turn a beer in the Ukraine Soviet authorities are telling the world very little about what is happening there but it\u0027s clear that a disaster of major proportions has occurred main television use hair analysis two people were killed in the nuclear accident the structure itself was destroyed and the wall speak of reasonable disaster of nineteen eighty six showed just how devastating a nuclear acts could be a radioactive plume contaminated a huge swathe of Europe from Ukraine to Scandinavia according to energy consultant Michael Snyder who opposes nuclear power memories of the accident a shaping attitudes to the industry to this day people forget but that in the UK you had you know sheep farmers that were under restriction orders until two thousand twelve from an accident fifteen hundred kilometers further distance so that left a very profound impression on the European population but although there\u0027s relatively little enthusiasm for nuclear power in Europe and North America in other regions it has much stronger support as Peter cannon lead energy analyst at the economist intelligence unit\u0027s explains the outlook for nuclear power is quite good especially in China and also in South Korea India and Russia that\u0027s money because they raise very fast growth in electricity consumption so these countries need to satisfy that increasing demand for power anyway they can and they\u0027ll say see nuclear power as a viable like carbon option but in the end the long term success or failure of the nuclear industry may come down to simple economics the costs of building reactors insuring safety dealing with waste and decommissioning redundant facilities are very high while generating electricity from gas is currently a lot cheaper and ultimately that may prove to be a bigger obstacle to the growth of nuclear power than the legacy the Fukushima when the elegance of course you had briefly from lady Robert judge the former head of the U. case atomic energy authority and an adviser to the board up tempo I interviewed her analyst washing her view was the long term scale of the damage to human health and the environment from the crew Fukushima disaster anybody who says they really know anything about anything it\u0027s probably wrong or at least know everything I believe that what\u0027s happening in Fukushima now is in the very best and brightest direction I believe that there is a handle on the decommissioning process the government and telco and the other big Japanese companies have banded together to provide the best decommissioning the most modern in do they have to keep inventing things to deal with cleaning up Fukushima with respect to the radiation actually if you talk to doctors I brought a woman named Jerry Thomas whose radiation specialists from imperial college I brought her to go to Fukushima to see what was going on there and from the radiation specialists they all believe that that actually Fukushima when it\u0027s cleaned up will be fine it\u0027s just like any of the other decommission plans that wheat with ridiculously Haro right here the fact is it\u0027s taken a long time but they\u0027re on the right road now there a lot of foreign experts coming in to help the Japanese into the whole world a nuclear community is focused on making sure the best possibly can be done to Fukushima will be and my own opinion I think we we will at this point find that the radiation damage is whatever there was and remember nobody die from radiation in Fukushima they certainly were problems in moving the people away from it but not actual radiation I think at this point it\u0027s on the very right wrote but efforts and money and training and time will continue to be needed for a long time so what lessons have been learned to think a lot a lot of lessons have been learned from Fukushima first of all what\u0027s learned is that every nuclear power plant needs a safety culture a very strong safety felt every nuclear power plant needs an independent regulator and there has to be a regulatory tension the regulator can\u0027t be too friendly with the operators they have to feel that there\u0027s a real when I call regulatory attention there has to be continual checks of what the equipment\u0027s doing people have to think the unthinkable left I mean in terms of Fukushima member twenty thousand people died from the earthquake but the power plants stayed up after the earthquake it was the tsunami that came and knocked out the back up systems which turned out the lights which meant everybody was operating in the dark and then there was actually no system of crisis control at the time today we know that when there\u0027s a crisis one person in the plant makes the decision I think that sometimes it\u0027s horrible to service but sometimes good things come from bad things you know in my opinion the whole world has learned a lot of lesson about the operation of nuclear power plants I was an SEC commissioner yes he was set up because we had the terrible depression in nineteen twenty nine in the stock market crash in America and a lot stock market crashes because they were really bad dealings going on in the markets thats why they set up the SEC the FCC has made the American markets wide and deep for many years regulation in the city of London really started with Maxwell crisis Maxwell was not a gentleman like the London people who\u0027d been in the city before thoughts when good regulation started lots of things that are really unfortunate end up having some good consequences and my hope is the Fukushima will change the way nuclear power plants are run around the world lady Barbara judge that two heavyweight British political figures of wages into the debate today about whether Britain should leave the European Union has first major speech since openly backing brexit London map hours Johnson has that leaving the EU is a win win claiming the UK could thrive and prosper as never before but the former prime minister Tony Blair told campaign it\u0027s for Britain to stay in the European Union to make the case with passion saying it\u0027s the UK\u0027s destiny to lead in Europe away from the sound bites on the campaign trail businesses large and small contemplating two very different futures both with uncertainty attached one huge question a grappling with is just how difficult it might be to unpack legislation which originates from Europe but is now enshrined in you can\u0027t know David hall is a partner from the international November just Hammond who advises corporate firms on domestic and international disputes he told me that it would not be easy you have to remember we spent forty years as part of the European Union Honda for forty years harmonizing our two legal systems under the laws that we have and so if he\u0027s going to be a very complex process to do that will work on various levels of the first things will have to do is that the big thing of having given notice to come out of the European you we will have to negotiate the continued relationship and integration between our legal system because just because we **** three European Union doesn\u0027t mean that we don\u0027t have a need to understand with our close trading partners how altitude ecosystems would work together this huge raft of peer legislation that ready governs how the UK operates there\u0027s a difference that was in that between European regulations and European directives yes strikes a regulation is something which has a direct effect into English school what that means is that we don\u0027t need any further English as a selection to make it have affect in the UK a directive however is a pronouncement all of the things that the European Union wants the the member states to bring into effect on their own who\u0027ll say if there was to be a brexit regulations would essentially disappear overnight we would remove ourselves from those and presumably we would then have to work out which of those actually really all the wounds it and so to workout how we keep the benefit of those regulations and remove those we don\u0027t want directives however a little complicated in that they are actually part of UK law and say that was lost would remain and if we didn\u0027t like those pits the legislature would have to workout how it Worsley Xie\u0027s those from the UK statute book sellers of what the lawyers huge outlook brother Moore with politicians and government put on them and massive button on the government to workout how and what needed to stay I\u0027m what would be to be brought in to replace that which it conference I\u0027ve got a regulation which is supervised by a body in the new adult body would no longer have jurisdiction to supervise those issues in England so we would have to therefore establish a replacement multi to to look at those things to what extent with this course at a huge headache for big corporations that you already advice yes well it is a it is a headache business thrives on certainty I work comes the long this is one way one to her certainly the rules that govern them in the outcomes of those rules and then they won\u0027t have certainty is what will happen if they have a speeds on those rules will they have a a quick and efficient and predictable outcome which they can then enforce top of the to do list will of course be renegotiating those trade agreements but how long could that tape why I think that he\u0027s probably the most important beta ultimately the Amy was established for many reasons but for free trade that has been established if we all now voting to remove ourselves from big free trade area we will have to negotiate how is that we can access that territory to address things like tariffs and non tariff based barriers to trade like licensing squashes quantity and that was David ho from budget fan it\u0027s time now to take a look at the financial markets and we can speak to bank him off seven investment management hello that bags of the markets is still digesting that move by the European central bank to cut key interest rates and flood the market with more liquidity yes it\u0027s it was a bit of a weird one ready now we know yesterday the markets initially rallied strongly on that fell again by the end of the day talking in particular about Europe now today the applicant very strongly taking most of the rest of the world with the so it seems that initially we thought this is everything we\u0027ve asked for and on further reflection people in the markets thought well we\u0027re not quite sure on the details after night digesting the details it seems that in fact Mr trophy house delivered the kind of stimulus that everybody wanted so pretty buoyant ready for the markets overall would you say yeah I think so European banks reps exit off percent today Europe the rest of Europe is up about three and a half percent it what Mr Draghi has really done is make sure the lending in the eurozone is that was easy as possible for banks to get on board with and he hasn\u0027t hurt the interest margin profit margins assistance okay thank you very much Ben Kimmel of seven investments management let me give you some of the latest numbers now from the financial markets and in London the one hundred Sharon Texas up one point seven percent at sixty one forty in New York the Dow is up one point three percent at seventeen thousand two hundred and ten gold is trading at one thousand two hundred and fifty nine dollars an ounce on the currency markets the gear I was at one dollar eleven point eight U. S. sense the pound is that one dollar forty four point one and April New York light crude oil is cut me up eighty three cents at fifty eight point six seven dollars a barrel it\u0027s that time of the week now when we can look back at just some of the stories which it made the headlines yeah nnat European central bank has announced new measures to boost the flagging eurozone economy further below zero makes the business models all bonds and insurance unsustainable in carts savers it is unclear died will promote five there are spending stop trump the Republican campaign to derail the property billionaires tilt for the White House the Republican Party as we have understood it free trade polite iffy wasabi party will never be the same if trump is the nominee the central bank in Bangladesh says the packets of stolen and unspecified amount of money from its account at the New York federal reserve we haven\u0027t gotten to the bottom of the story all the New York fed is saying is that their systems have not been breached that\u0027s doesn\u0027t mean there couldn\u0027t there hacking from China or somewhere else nnj so did you stop them well as we heard just now in the markets the European central bank has fought off a ministry policy bazooka but just how long will the effects last plus the presidential primary debates in the U.

E. O. emails criminals a thought have got about two billion dollars from this you would expect would you John that systems at the New York federal reserve would\u0027ve been good enough to withstand the as you would expect and I think that of the good work of our colleagues in Europe on reporting this is going to result in a lot of review of how this happened because of it happened for Bangladesh one wonders who else has it happened for in other words not cannot happen again or will it happen again but where has it already happened that we just don\u0027t know this just goes to show that biggest intuitions big financial institutions are not impervious two what is it and credible global scourge at this point and that was John Makdessi associate editor of the wallstreet journal in New York and in that discussion with and they know who\u0027s capsule markets correspondent at the Financial Times in London that\u0027s all for this edition of world business report you can keep in touch by email well don\u0027t business at BBC dot co dot UK or on Twitter BBC world base from all of us here thank you for downloading from the BBC world service you can find a whole world of information from science arts business and technology just go to the BBC world service dot com slash pub because",

K.\u0027s atomic energy authority and an adviser to the Fukushima plant undetected explains there was going to be a nuclear renaissance in Europe and not only faucet here in the UK but the Italians and the Germans and the Polish and the Hungarians and a whole bunch of European countries for building or renewing their power plants a lot of those countries of pull back from that off difficult shimmer Germany and Switzerland decided to phase out nuclear power altogether even fronts which relies on reactors for three quarters of its electricity has seen its industry suffer because its once thriving export markets have dried up but some experts believe the seeds of this decline were actually sign a quarter of a century the full Fukushima the Soviet Union has admitted that an accident has taken place at a nuclear power station turn a beer in the Ukraine Soviet authorities are telling the world very little about what is happening there but it\u0027s clear that a disaster of major proportions has occurred main television use hair analysis two people were killed in the nuclear accident the structure itself was destroyed and the wall speak of reasonable disaster of nineteen eighty six showed just how devastating a nuclear acts could be a radioactive plume contaminated a huge swathe of Europe from Ukraine to Scandinavia according to energy consultant Michael Snyder who opposes nuclear power memories of the accident a shaping attitudes to the industry to this day people forget but that in the UK you had you know sheep farmers that were under restriction orders until two thousand twelve from an accident fifteen hundred kilometers further distance so that left a very profound impression on the European population but although there\u0027s relatively little enthusiasm for nuclear power in Europe and North America in other regions it has much stronger support as Peter cannon lead energy analyst at the economist intelligence unit\u0027s explains the outlook for nuclear power is quite good especially in China and also in South Korea India and Russia that\u0027s money because they raise very fast growth in electricity consumption so these countries need to satisfy that increasing demand for power anyway they can and they\u0027ll say see nuclear power as a viable like carbon option but in the end the long term success or failure of the nuclear industry may come down to simple economics the costs of building reactors insuring safety dealing with waste and decommissioning redundant facilities are very high while generating electricity from gas is currently a lot cheaper and ultimately that may prove to be a bigger obstacle to the growth of nuclear power than the legacy the Fukushima when the elegance of course you had briefly from lady Robert judge the former head of the U. case atomic energy authority and an adviser to the board up tempo I interviewed her analyst washing her view was the long term scale of the damage to human health and the environment from the crew Fukushima disaster anybody who says they really know anything about anything it\u0027s probably wrong or at least know everything I believe that what\u0027s happening in Fukushima now is in the very best and brightest direction I believe that there is a handle on the decommissioning process the government and telco and the other big Japanese companies have banded together to provide the best decommissioning the most modern in do they have to keep inventing things to deal with cleaning up Fukushima with respect to the radiation actually if you talk to doctors I brought a woman named Jerry Thomas whose radiation specialists from imperial college I brought her to go to Fukushima to see what was going on there and from the radiation specialists they all believe that that actually Fukushima when it\u0027s cleaned up will be fine it\u0027s just like any of the other decommission plans that wheat with ridiculously Haro right here the fact is it\u0027s taken a long time but they\u0027re on the right road now there a lot of foreign experts coming in to help the Japanese into the whole world a nuclear community is focused on making sure the best possibly can be done to Fukushima will be and my own opinion I think we we will at this point find that the radiation damage is whatever there was and remember nobody die from radiation in Fukushima they certainly were problems in moving the people away from it but not actual radiation I think at this point it\u0027s on the very right wrote but efforts and money and training and time will continue to be needed for a long time so what lessons have been learned to think a lot a lot of lessons have been learned from Fukushima first of all what\u0027s learned is that every nuclear power plant needs a safety culture a very strong safety felt every nuclear power plant needs an independent regulator and there has to be a regulatory tension the regulator can\u0027t be too friendly with the operators they have to feel that there\u0027s a real when I call regulatory attention there has to be continual checks of what the equipment\u0027s doing people have to think the unthinkable left I mean in terms of Fukushima member twenty thousand people died from the earthquake but the power plants stayed up after the earthquake it was the tsunami that came and knocked out the back up systems which turned out the lights which meant everybody was operating in the dark and then there was actually no system of crisis control at the time today we know that when there\u0027s a crisis one person in the plant makes the decision I think that sometimes it\u0027s horrible to service but sometimes good things come from bad things you know in my opinion the whole world has learned a lot of lesson about the operation of nuclear power plants I was an SEC commissioner yes he was set up because we had the terrible depression in nineteen twenty nine in the stock market crash in America and a lot stock market crashes because they were really bad dealings going on in the markets thats why they set up the SEC the FCC has made the American markets wide and deep for many years regulation in the city of London really started with Maxwell crisis Maxwell was not a gentleman like the London people who\u0027d been in the city before thoughts when good regulation started lots of things that are really unfortunate end up having some good consequences and my hope is the Fukushima will change the way nuclear power plants are run around the world lady Barbara judge that two heavyweight British political figures of wages into the debate today about whether Britain should leave the European Union has first major speech since openly backing brexit London map hours Johnson has that leaving the EU is a win win claiming the UK could thrive and prosper as never before but the former prime minister Tony Blair told campaign it\u0027s for Britain to stay in the European Union to make the case with passion saying it\u0027s the UK\u0027s destiny to lead in Europe away from the sound bites on the campaign trail businesses large and small contemplating two very different futures both with uncertainty attached one huge question a grappling with is just how difficult it might be to unpack legislation which originates from Europe but is now enshrined in you can\u0027t know David hall is a partner from the international November just Hammond who advises corporate firms on domestic and international disputes he told me that it would not be easy you have to remember we spent forty years as part of the European Union Honda for forty years harmonizing our two legal systems under the laws that we have and so if he\u0027s going to be a very complex process to do that will work on various levels of the first things will have to do is that the big thing of having given notice to come out of the European you we will have to negotiate the continued relationship and integration between our legal system because just because we **** three European Union doesn\u0027t mean that we don\u0027t have a need to understand with our close trading partners how altitude ecosystems would work together this huge raft of peer legislation that ready governs how the UK operates there\u0027s a difference that was in that between European regulations and European directives yes strikes a regulation is something which has a direct effect into English school what that means is that we don\u0027t need any further English as a selection to make it have affect in the UK a directive however is a pronouncement all of the things that the European Union wants the the member states to bring into effect on their own who\u0027ll say if there was to be a brexit regulations would essentially disappear overnight we would remove ourselves from those and presumably we would then have to work out which of those actually really all the wounds it and so to workout how we keep the benefit of those regulations and remove those we don\u0027t want directives however a little complicated in that they are actually part of UK law and say that was lost would remain and if we didn\u0027t like those pits the legislature would have to workout how it Worsley Xie\u0027s those from the UK statute book sellers of what the lawyers huge outlook brother Moore with politicians and government put on them and massive button on the government to workout how and what needed to stay I\u0027m what would be to be brought in to replace that which it conference I\u0027ve got a regulation which is supervised by a body in the new adult body would no longer have jurisdiction to supervise those issues in England so we would have to therefore establish a replacement multi to to look at those things to what extent with this course at a huge headache for big corporations that you already advice yes well it is a it is a headache business thrives on certainty I work comes the long this is one way one to her certainly the rules that govern them in the outcomes of those rules and then they won\u0027t have certainty is what will happen if they have a speeds on those rules will they have a a quick and efficient and predictable outcome which they can then enforce top of the to do list will of course be renegotiating those trade agreements but how long could that tape why I think that he\u0027s probably the most important beta ultimately the Amy was established for many reasons but for free trade that has been established if we all now voting to remove ourselves from big free trade area we will have to negotiate how is that we can access that territory to address things like tariffs and non tariff based barriers to trade like licensing squashes quantity and that was David ho from budget

shimmer Germany and Switzerland decided to phase out nuclear power altogether even fronts which relies on reactors for three quarters of its electricity has seen its industry suffer because its once thriving export markets have dried up but some experts believe the seeds of this decline were actually sign a quarter of a century the full Fukushima the Soviet Union has admitted that an accident has taken place at a nuclear power station turn a beer in the Ukraine Soviet authorities are telling the world very little about what is happening there but it\u0027s clear that a disaster of major proportions has occurred main television use hair analysis two people were killed in the nuclear accident the structure itself was destroyed and the wall speak of reasonable disaster of nineteen eighty six showed just how devastating a nuclear acts could be a radioactive plume contaminated a huge swathe of Europe from Ukraine to Scandinavia according to energy consultant Michael Snyder who opposes nuclear power memories of the accident a shaping attitudes to the industry to this day people forget but that in the UK you had you know sheep farmers that were under restriction orders until two thousand twelve from an accident fifteen hundred kilometers further distance so that left a very profound impression on the European population but although there\u0027s relatively little enthusiasm for nuclear power in Europe and North America in other regions it has much stronger support as Peter cannon lead energy analyst at the economist intelligence unit\u0027s explains the outlook for nuclear power is quite good especially in China and also in South Korea India and Russia that\u0027s money because they raise very fast growth in electricity consumption so these countries need to satisfy that increasing demand for power anyway they can and they\u0027ll say see nuclear power as a viable like carbon option but in the end the long term success or failure of the nuclear industry may come down to simple economics the costs of building reactors insuring safety dealing with waste and decommissioning redundant facilities are very high while generating electricity from gas is currently a lot cheaper and ultimately that may prove to be a bigger obstacle to the growth of nuclear power than the legacy the Fukushima when the elegance of course you had briefly from lady Robert judge the former head of the U. case atomic energy authority and an adviser to the board up tempo I interviewed her analyst washing her view was the long term scale of the damage to human health and the environment from the crew Fukushima disaster anybody who says they really know anything about anything it\u0027s probably wrong or at least know everything I believe that what\u0027s happening in Fukushima now is in the very best and brightest direction I believe that there is a handle on the decommissioning process the government and telco and the other big Japanese companies have banded together to provide the best decommissioning the most modern in do they have to keep inventing things to deal with cleaning up Fukushima with respect to the radiation actually if you talk to doctors I brought a woman named Jerry Thomas whose radiation specialists from imperial college I brought her to go to Fukushima to see what was going on there and from the radiation specialists they all believe that that actually Fukushima when it\u0027s cleaned up will be fine it\u0027s just like any of the other decommission plans that wheat with ridiculously Haro right here the fact is it\u0027s taken a long time but they\u0027re on the right road now there a lot of foreign experts coming in to help the Japanese into the whole world a nuclear community is focused on making sure the best possibly can be done to Fukushima will be and my own opinion I think we we will at this point find that the radiation damage is whatever there was and remember nobody die from radiation in Fukushima they certainly were problems in moving the people away from it but not actual radiation I think at this point it\u0027s on the very right wrote but efforts and money and training and time will continue to be needed for a long time so what lessons have been learned to think a lot a lot of lessons have been learned from Fukushima first of all what\u0027s learned is that every nuclear power plant needs a safety culture a very strong safety felt every nuclear power plant needs an independent regulator and there has to be a regulatory tension the regulator can\u0027t be too friendly with the operators they have to feel that there\u0027s a real when I call regulatory attention there has to be continual checks of what the equipment\u0027s doing people have to think the unthinkable left I mean in terms of Fukushima member twenty thousand people died from the earthquake but the power plants stayed up after the earthquake it was the tsunami that came and knocked out the back up systems which turned out the lights which meant everybody was operating in the dark and then there was actually no system of crisis control at the time today we know that when there\u0027s a crisis one person in the plant makes the decision I think that sometimes it\u0027s horrible to service but sometimes good things come from bad things you know in my opinion the whole world has learned a lot of lesson about the operation of nuclear power plants I was an SEC commissioner yes he was set up because we had the terrible depression in nineteen twenty nine in the stock market crash in America and a lot stock market crashes because they were really bad dealings going on in the markets thats why they set up the SEC the FCC has made the American markets wide and deep for many years regulation in the city of London really started with Maxwell crisis Maxwell was not a gentleman like the London people who\u0027d been in the city before thoughts when good regulation started lots of things that are really unfortunate end up having some good consequences and my hope is the Fukushima will change the way nuclear power plants are run around the world lady Barbara judge that two heavyweight British political figures of wages into the debate today about whether Britain should leave the European Union has first major speech since openly backing brexit London map hours Johnson has that leaving the EU is a win win claiming the UK could thrive and prosper as never before but the former prime minister Tony Blair told campaign it\u0027s for Britain to stay in the European Union to make the case with passion saying it\u0027s the UK\u0027s destiny to lead in Europe away from the sound bites on the campaign trail businesses large and small contemplating two very different futures both with uncertainty attached one huge question a grappling with is just how difficult it might be to unpack legislation which originates from Europe but is now enshrined in you can\u0027t know David hall is a partner from the international November just Hammond who advises corporate firms on domestic and international disputes he told me that it would not be easy you have to remember we spent forty years as part of the European Union Honda for forty years harmonizing our two legal systems under the laws that we have and so if he\u0027s going to be a very complex process to do that will work on various levels of the first things will have to do is that the big thing of having given notice to come out of the European you we will have to negotiate the continued relationship and integration between our legal system because just because we **** three European Union doesn\u0027t mean that we don\u0027t have a need to understand with our close trading partners how altitude ecosystems would work together this huge raft of peer legislation that ready governs how the UK operates there\u0027s a difference that was in that between European regulations and European directives yes strikes a regulation is something which has a direct effect into English school what that means is that we don\u0027t need any further English as a selection to make it have affect in the UK a directive however is a pronouncement all of the things that the European Union wants the the member states to bring into effect on their own who\u0027ll say if there was to be a brexit regulations would essentially disappear overnight we would remove ourselves from those and presumably we would then have to work out which of those actually really all the wounds it and so to workout how we keep the benefit of those regulations and remove those we don\u0027t want directives however a little complicated in that they are actually part of UK law and say that was lost would remain and if we didn\u0027t like those pits the legislature would have to workout how it Worsley Xie\u0027s those from the UK statute book sellers of what the lawyers huge outlook brother Moore with politicians and government put on them and massive button on the government to workout how and what needed to stay I\u0027m what would be to be brought in to replace that which it conference I\u0027ve got a regulation which is supervised by a body in the new adult body would no longer have jurisdiction to supervise those issues in England so we would have to therefore establish a replacement multi to to look at those things to what extent with this course at a huge headache for big corporations that you already advice yes well it is a it is a headache business thrives on certainty I work comes the long this is one way one to her certainly the rules that govern them in the outcomes of those rules and then they won\u0027t have certainty is what will happen if they have a speeds on those rules will they have a a quick and efficient and predictable outcome which they can then enforce top of the to do list will of course be renegotiating those trade agreements but how long could that tape why I think that he\u0027s probably the most important beta ultimately the Amy was established for many reasons but for free trade that has been established if we all now voting to remove ourselves from big free trade area we will have to negotiate how is that we can access that territory to address things like tariffs and non tariff based barriers to trade like licensing squashes quantity and that was David ho from budget fan it\u0027s time now to take a look at the financial markets and we can speak to bank him off seven investment management hello that bags of the markets is still digesting that move by the European central bank to cut key interest rates and flood the market with more liquidity yes it\u0027s it was a bit of a weird one ready now we know yesterday the markets initially rallied strongly on that fell again by the end of the day talking in particular about Europe now today the applicant very strongly taking most of the rest of the world with the so it seems that initially we thought this is everything we\u0027ve asked for and on further reflection people in the markets thought well we\u0027re not quite sure on the details after night digesting the details it seems that in fact Mr trophy house delivered the kind of stimulus that everybody wanted so pretty buoyant ready for the markets overall would you say yeah I think so European banks reps exit off percent today Europe the rest of Europe is up about three and a half percent it what Mr Draghi has really done is make sure the lending in the eurozone is that was easy as possible for banks to get on board with and he hasn\u0027t hurt the interest margin profit margins assistance okay thank you very much Ben Kimmel of seven investments management let me give you some of the latest numbers now from the financial markets and in London the one hundred Sharon Texas up one point seven percent at sixty one forty in New York the Dow is up one point three percent at seventeen thousand two hundred and ten gold is trading at one thousand two hundred and fifty nine dollars an ounce on the currency markets the gear I was at one dollar eleven point eight U. S. sense the pound is that one dollar forty four point one and April New York light crude oil is cut me up eighty three cents at fifty eight point six seven dollars a barrel it\u0027s that time of the week now when we can look back at just some of the stories which it made the headlines yeah nnat European central bank has announced new measures to boost the flagging eurozone economy further below zero makes the business models all bonds and insurance unsustainable in carts savers it is unclear died will promote five there are spending stop trump the Republican campaign to derail the property billionaires tilt for the White House the Republican Party as we have understood it free trade polite iffy wasabi party will never be the same if trump is the nominee the central bank in Bangladesh says the packets of stolen and unspecified amount of money from its account at the New York federal reserve we haven\u0027t gotten to the bottom of the story all the New York fed is saying is that their systems have not been breached that\u0027s doesn\u0027t mean there couldn\u0027t there hacking from China or somewhere else nnj so did you stop them well as we heard just now in the markets the European central bank has fought off a ministry policy bazooka but just how long will the effects last plus the presidential primary debates in the U. S. protectionism has read it has what would high tariff barriers mean for the American economy and the cyber heist at the New York federal reserve when he did those missing millions go wild to discuss those subjects I speak to Elaine more who\u0027s the capital markets correspondent at the Financial Times and London that\u0027ll say with Joan bus eight associate editor of the wallstreet journal in New York it warmed markets around the world initially and I think markets began to reflect on the deployment of the bazooka and the continuing concern that a previous fires from various armaments bi drugih I have not ignited the economy in Europe at a certain point psychology says this is an extraordinary measure set of measures that he has taken all stimulative wow this is going to really fire up things in Europe then psychology shifts and says but he must be feeling truly desperate at this stage how bad is it are we underestimating how bad it is LA more is that your take on this and do you think by Draghi signifying that they won\u0027t be further cuts that kinda have led to a bit more of a lukewarm reception definitely Sarah trader that I speak to quite regularly said that there was a hush that descended across the floor as soon as Mary drug made that statement about not investing further cuts being made up to that point markets have been rallying so the the stimulus of a program that married Jackie had announced was far more than anyone had been expecting some of the economist I was speaking to you today now that the dust to settle that has said perhaps my doggy is actually trying to influence the real economy so have to think that what they all said it was cut the rate at which banks in Europe Campari money from the ECB so perhaps the focus this time is not on the financial markets but on trying to get the real economy in Europe going how are negative rates views in the United States negatively Europe now joins the gallery of economic rogues and include Japan this is not good company Japan\u0027s had Skinner twenty years of economic stagnation viewed as kind of a hail Mary pass an effort to move an economy that has not responded to previous monetary policy and it reminds everybody that there\u0027s a lot of structural dislocation of the European economy that needs to be addressed and has not been and if you\u0027re a saver etcetera because them to rush out and take that money out of a can spend which would be stimulative it\u0027s going to cause them to hunker down even further it\u0027s going to cause them to save some concerns raised about policy in Europe but wash about policy puts on the table in the United States John at the presidential primaries protectionism is Brady bread ring it\u0027s had isn\u0027t it it really is it\u0027s wild and woolly and unpredictable what\u0027s happening in the American political campaign right now you have Donald Trump the front runner in the Republican contest for the nomination to be president talking about putting up forty five percent tariffs on China if it doesn\u0027t behave now what is what is he mean by that and how specific has he been way hazmat specifically we don\u0027t know what he means but it is highly protective and it\u0027s usually language that you find not on the right but on the left in politics in the United States and yesterday a rich Trumka who\u0027s head of the AFL CIO the union of unions said of trump you know even a blind squirrel can find an acorn now and again meaning that he was aligned with trump on his trade policy which is a very unusual in American politics and Elaine on the left it certainly seems now is that Hillary Clinton is playing catch up with Betty Saunders he\u0027s Hadda already anti free trade campaign so far it\u0027s really interesting the bunnies on as it\u0027s been able to use the idea of global trade is something to to hit Hillary Clinton within the fact that she\u0027s retreated from her support of the trans Pacific partnership which is heralded as this pivot that U. S. was going to do towards Asia but I think that it does make sense in this point in the elections that the focus is on the domestic economy there\u0027s a lot of concerns about the living standard of middle class Americans fatty sort of stagnating and the impact on jobs of global trade the concern for the rest of the world is that the IMF is been saying recently global trade is slowing down and it\u0027s a problem and that they won\u0027t policymakers to get involved and the U. S. just when people right now Elaine is absolutely right I mean this is catering to a deep concern of the United States that living standards have not been rising for a vast stretch of the electorate odd that has seen their jobs move abroad up or has just been disrupted by the digital economy however it does have an effect on the global economic outlook if the world is looking at negative interest rates in Japan negative interest rates in Europe stagnating economies in both any United States that might be retrenching to its own shores a politically and even if some of that language results in actual policy you\u0027ll see further slowdown globally in the economy what about the story about the New York federal reserve and this type a heist which Bangladesh claims is coal states more than a hundred million dollars because he said he seemed early on in the week because they need the site was talking the same story this looks as if it was a hack through the Bangladesh system hackers came in they got passwords they got authorization keys that allow them to behave as if they were the Bangladesh central bank and they moved money out of the federal reserve to other places around the world where they cashed it in so it looks like it came in through Bangladesh but even if it did this raises incredible questions about security of big money flows in the world how was that allowed to happen how was the fed not on top of Bangladesh saying your systems are inadequate how was the the fed not able to verify transactions of that size with central authorities in Bangladesh before they were made this is going to have a lot of repercussions because the money was of such a large amount the point that I think is really incredible is the way that this was found out so it wasn\u0027t that either of the central banks was able to spot this it was that one of the hackers mis typed a word and so right foundations and a foundation at that point discovery was made that the money was going to sources that were not verified it\u0027s a huge scale of a problem that is happening all over the world right now so I was talking to somebody who said that slot twelve thousand businesses worldwide are estimated to have been hacked by these things with a C.

fan it\u0027s time now to take a look at the financial markets and we can speak to bank him off seven investment management hello that bags of the markets is still digesting that move by the European central bank to cut key interest rates and flood the market with more liquidity yes it\u0027s it was a bit of a weird one ready now we know yesterday the markets initially rallied strongly on that fell again by the end of the day talking in particular about Europe now today the applicant very strongly taking most of the rest of the world with the so it seems that initially we thought this is everything we\u0027ve asked for and on further reflection people in the markets thought well we\u0027re not quite sure on the details after night digesting the details it seems that in fact Mr trophy house delivered the kind of stimulus that everybody wanted so pretty buoyant ready for the markets overall would you say yeah I think so European banks reps exit off percent today Europe the rest of Europe is up about three and a half percent it what Mr Draghi has really done is make sure the lending in the eurozone is that was easy as possible for banks to get on board with and he hasn\u0027t hurt the interest margin profit margins assistance okay thank you very much Ben Kimmel of seven investments management let me give you some of the latest numbers now from the financial markets and in London the one hundred Sharon Texas up one point seven percent at sixty one forty in New York the Dow is up one point three percent at seventeen thousand two hundred and ten gold is trading at one thousand two hundred and fifty nine dollars an ounce on the currency markets the gear I was at one dollar eleven point eight U. S. sense the pound is that one dollar forty four point one and April New York light crude oil is cut me up eighty three cents at fifty eight point six seven dollars a barrel it\u0027s that time of the week now when we can look back at just some of the stories which it made the headlines yeah nnat European central bank has announced new measures to boost the flagging eurozone economy further below zero makes the business models all bonds and insurance unsustainable in carts savers it is unclear died will promote five there are spending stop trump the Republican campaign to derail the property billionaires tilt for the White House the Republican Party as we have understood it free trade polite iffy wasabi party will never be the same if trump is the nominee the central bank in Bangladesh says the packets of stolen and unspecified amount of money from its account at the New York federal reserve we haven\u0027t gotten to the bottom of the story all the New York fed is saying is that their systems have not been breached that\u0027s doesn\u0027t mean there couldn\u0027t there hacking from China or somewhere else nnj so did you stop them well as we heard just now in the markets the European central bank has fought off a ministry policy bazooka but just how long will the effects last plus the presidential primary debates in the U. S. protectionism has read it has what would high tariff barriers mean for the American economy and the cyber heist at the New York federal reserve when he did those missing millions go wild to discuss those subjects I speak to Elaine more who\u0027s the capital markets correspondent at the Financial Times and London that\u0027ll say with Joan bus eight associate editor of the wallstreet journal in New York it warmed markets around the world initially and I think markets began to reflect on the deployment of the bazooka and the continuing concern that a previous fires from various armaments bi drugih I have not ignited the economy in Europe at a certain point psychology says this is an extraordinary measure set of measures that he has taken all stimulative wow this is going to really fire up things in Europe then psychology shifts and says but he must be feeling truly desperate at this stage how bad is it are we underestimating how bad it is LA more is that your take on this and do you think by Draghi signifying that they won\u0027t be further cuts that kinda have led to a bit more of a lukewarm reception definitely Sarah trader that I speak to quite regularly said that there was a hush that descended across the floor as soon as Mary drug made that statement about not investing further cuts being made up to that point markets have been rallying so the the stimulus of a program that married Jackie had announced was far more than anyone had been expecting some of the economist I was speaking to you today now that the dust to settle that has said perhaps my doggy is actually trying to influence the real economy so have to think that what they all said it was cut the rate at which banks in Europe Campari money from the ECB so perhaps the focus this time is not on the financial markets but on trying to get the real economy in Europe going how are negative rates views in the United States negatively Europe now joins the gallery of economic rogues and include Japan this is not good company Japan\u0027s had Skinner twenty years of economic stagnation viewed as kind of a hail Mary pass an effort to move an economy that has not responded to previous monetary policy and it reminds everybody that there\u0027s a lot of structural dislocation of the European economy that needs to be addressed and has not been and if you\u0027re a saver etcetera because them to rush out and take that money out of a can spend which would be stimulative it\u0027s going to cause them to hunker down even further it\u0027s going to cause them to save some concerns raised about policy in Europe but wash about policy puts on the table in the United States John at the presidential primaries protectionism is Brady bread ring it\u0027s had isn\u0027t it it really is it\u0027s wild and woolly and unpredictable what\u0027s happening in the American political campaign right now you have Donald Trump the front runner in the Republican contest for the nomination to be president talking about putting up forty five percent tariffs on China if it doesn\u0027t behave now what is what is he mean by that and how specific has he been way hazmat specifically we don\u0027t know what he means but it is highly protective and it\u0027s usually language that you find not on the right but on the left in politics in the United States and yesterday a rich Trumka who\u0027s head of the AFL CIO the union of unions said of trump you know even a blind squirrel can find an acorn now and again meaning that he was aligned with trump on his trade policy which is a very unusual in American politics and Elaine on the left it certainly seems now is that Hillary Clinton is playing catch up with Betty Saunders he\u0027s Hadda already anti free trade campaign so far it\u0027s really interesting the bunnies on as it\u0027s been able to use the idea of global trade is something to to hit Hillary Clinton within the fact that she\u0027s retreated from her support of the trans Pacific partnership which is heralded as this pivot that U. S. was going to do towards Asia but I think that it does make sense in this point in the elections that the focus is on the domestic economy there\u0027s a lot of concerns about the living standard of middle class Americans fatty sort of stagnating and the impact on jobs of global trade the concern for the rest of the world is that the IMF is been saying recently global trade is slowing down and it\u0027s a problem and that they won\u0027t policymakers to get involved and the U. S. just when people right now Elaine is absolutely right I mean this is catering to a deep concern of the United States that living standards have not been rising for a vast stretch of the electorate odd that has seen their jobs move abroad up or has just been disrupted by the digital economy however it does have an effect on the global economic outlook if the world is looking at negative interest rates in Japan negative interest rates in Europe stagnating economies in both any United States that might be retrenching to its own shores a politically and even if some of that language results in actual policy you\u0027ll see further slowdown globally in the economy what about the story about the New York federal reserve and this type a heist which Bangladesh claims is coal states more than a hundred million dollars because he said he seemed early on in the week because they need the site was talking the same story this looks as if it was a hack through the Bangladesh system hackers came in they got passwords they got authorization keys that allow them to behave as if they were the Bangladesh central bank and they moved money out of the federal reserve to other places around the world where they cashed it in so it looks like it came in through Bangladesh but even if it did this raises incredible questions about security of big money flows in the world how was that allowed to happen how was the fed not on top of Bangladesh saying your systems are inadequate how was the the fed not able to verify transactions of that size with central authorities in Bangladesh before they were made this is going to have a lot of repercussions because the money was of such a large amount the point that I think is really incredible is the way that this was found out so it wasn\u0027t that either of the central banks was able to spot this it was that one of the hackers mis typed a word and so right foundations and a foundation at that point discovery was made that the money was going to sources that were not verified it\u0027s a huge scale of a problem that is happening all over the world right now so I was talking to somebody who said that slot twelve thousand businesses worldwide are estimated to have been hacked by these things with a C. E. O. emails criminals a thought have got about two billion dollars from this you would expect would you John that systems at the New York federal reserve would\u0027ve been good enough to withstand the as you would expect and I think that of the good work of our colleagues in Europe on reporting this is going to result in a lot of review of how this happened because of it happened for Bangladesh one wonders who else has it happened for in other words not cannot happen again or will it happen again but where has it already happened that we just don\u0027t know this just goes to show that biggest intuitions big financial institutions are not impervious two what is it and credible global scourge at this point and that was John Makdessi associate editor of the wallstreet journal in New York and in that discussion with and they know who\u0027s capsule markets correspondent at the Financial Times in London that\u0027s all for this edition of world business report you can keep in touch by email well don\u0027t business at BBC dot co dot UK or on Twitter BBC world base from all of us here thank you for downloading from the BBC world service you can find a whole world of information from science arts business and technology just go to the BBC world service dot com slash pub because",

central bank to cut key interest rates and flood the market with more liquidity yes it\u0027s it was a bit of a weird one ready now we know yesterday the markets initially rallied strongly on that fell again by the end of the day talking in particular about Europe now today the applicant very strongly taking most of the rest of the world with the so it seems that initially we thought this is everything we\u0027ve asked for and on further reflection people in the markets thought well we\u0027re not quite sure on the details after night digesting the details it seems that in fact Mr trophy house delivered the kind of stimulus that everybody wanted so pretty buoyant ready for the markets overall would you say yeah I think so European banks reps exit off percent today Europe the rest of Europe is up about three and a half percent it what Mr Draghi has really done is make sure the lending in the eurozone is that was easy as possible for banks to get on board with and he hasn\u0027t hurt the interest margin profit margins assistance okay thank you very much Ben Kimmel of seven investments management let me give you some of the latest numbers now from the financial markets and in London the one hundred Sharon Texas up one point seven percent at sixty one forty in New York the Dow is up one point three percent at seventeen thousand two hundred and ten gold is trading at one thousand two hundred and fifty nine dollars an ounce on the currency markets the gear I was at one dollar eleven point eight U. S. sense the pound is that one dollar forty four point one and April New York light crude oil is cut me up eighty three cents at fifty eight point six seven dollars a barrel it\u0027s that time of the week now when we can look back at just some of the stories which it made the headlines yeah nnat European central bank has announced new measures to boost the flagging eurozone economy further below zero makes the business models all bonds and insurance unsustainable in carts savers it is unclear died will promote five there are spending stop trump the Republican campaign to derail the property billionaires tilt for the White House the Republican Party as we have understood it free trade polite iffy wasabi party will never be the same if trump is the nominee the central bank in Bangladesh says the packets of stolen and unspecified amount of money from its account at the New York federal reserve we haven\u0027t gotten to the bottom of the story all the New York fed is saying is that their systems have not been breached that\u0027s doesn\u0027t mean there couldn\u0027t there hacking from China or somewhere else nnj so did you stop them well as we heard just now in the markets the European central bank has fought off a ministry policy bazooka but just how long will the effects last plus the presidential primary debates in the U. S. protectionism has read it has what would high tariff barriers mean for the American economy and the cyber heist at the New York federal reserve when he did those missing millions go wild to discuss those subjects I speak to Elaine more who\u0027s the capital markets correspondent at the Financial Times and London that\u0027ll say with Joan bus eight associate editor of the wallstreet journal in New York it warmed markets around the world initially and I think markets began to reflect on the deployment of the bazooka and the continuing concern that a previous fires from various armaments bi drugih I have not ignited the economy in Europe at a certain point psychology says this is an extraordinary measure set of measures that he has taken all stimulative wow this is going to really fire up things in Europe then psychology shifts and says but he must be feeling truly desperate at this stage how bad is it are we underestimating how bad it is LA more is that your take on this and do you think by Draghi signifying that they won\u0027t be further cuts that kinda have led to a bit more of a lukewarm reception definitely Sarah trader that I speak to quite regularly said that there was a hush that descended across the floor as soon as Mary drug made that statement about not investing further cuts being made up to that point markets have been rallying so the the stimulus of a program that married Jackie had announced was far more than anyone had been expecting some of the economist I was speaking to you today now that the dust to settle that has said perhaps my doggy is actually trying to influence the real economy so have to think that what they all said it was cut the rate at which banks in Europe Campari money from the ECB so perhaps the focus this time is not on the financial markets but on trying to get the real economy in Europe going how are negative rates views in the United States negatively Europe now joins the gallery of economic rogues and include Japan this is not good company Japan\u0027s had Skinner twenty years of economic stagnation viewed as kind of a hail Mary pass an effort to move an economy that has not responded to previous monetary policy and it reminds everybody that there\u0027s a lot of structural dislocation of the European economy that needs to be addressed and has not been and if you\u0027re a saver etcetera because them to rush out and take that money out of a can spend which would be stimulative it\u0027s going to cause them to hunker down even further it\u0027s going to cause them to save some concerns raised about policy in Europe but wash about policy puts on the table in the United States John at the presidential primaries protectionism is Brady bread ring it\u0027s had isn\u0027t it it really is it\u0027s wild and woolly and unpredictable what\u0027s happening in the American political campaign right now you have Donald Trump the front runner in the Republican contest for the nomination to be president talking about putting up forty five percent tariffs on China if it doesn\u0027t behave now what is what is he mean by that and how specific has he been way hazmat specifically we don\u0027t know what he means but it is highly protective and it\u0027s usually language that you find not on the right but on the left in politics in the United States and yesterday a rich Trumka who\u0027s head of the AFL CIO the union of unions said of trump you know even a blind squirrel can find an acorn now and again meaning that he was aligned with trump on his trade policy which is a very unusual in American politics and Elaine on the left it certainly seems now is that Hillary Clinton is playing catch up with Betty Saunders he\u0027s Hadda already anti free trade campaign so far it\u0027s really interesting the bunnies on as it\u0027s been able to use the idea of global trade is something to to hit Hillary Clinton within the fact that she\u0027s retreated from her support of the trans Pacific partnership which is heralded as this pivot that U. S. was going to do towards Asia but I think that it does make sense in this point in the elections that the focus is on the domestic economy there\u0027s a lot of concerns about the living standard of middle class Americans fatty sort of stagnating and the impact on jobs of global trade the concern for the rest of the world is that the IMF is been saying recently global trade is slowing down and it\u0027s a problem and that they won\u0027t policymakers to get involved and the U. S. just when people right now Elaine is absolutely right I mean this is catering to a deep concern of the United States that living standards have not been rising for a vast stretch of the electorate odd that has seen their jobs move abroad up or has just been disrupted by the digital economy however it does have an effect on the global economic outlook if the world is looking at negative interest rates in Japan negative interest rates in Europe stagnating economies in both any United States that might be retrenching to its own shores a politically and even if some of that language results in actual policy you\u0027ll see further slowdown globally in the economy what about the story about the New York federal reserve and this type a heist which Bangladesh claims is coal states more than a hundred million dollars because he said he seemed early on in the week because they need the site was talking the same story this looks as if it was a hack through the Bangladesh system hackers came in they got passwords they got authorization keys that allow them to behave as if they were the Bangladesh central bank and they moved money out of the federal reserve to other places around the world where they cashed it in so it looks like it came in through Bangladesh but even if it did this raises incredible questions about security of big money flows in the world how was that allowed to happen how was the fed not on top of Bangladesh saying your systems are inadequate how was the the fed not able to verify transactions of that size with central authorities in Bangladesh before they were made this is going to have a lot of repercussions because the money was of such a large amount the point that I think is really incredible is the way that this was found out so it wasn\u0027t that either of the central banks was able to spot this it was that one of the hackers mis typed a word and so right foundations and a foundation at that point discovery was made that the money was going to sources that were not verified it\u0027s a huge scale of a problem that is happening all over the world right now so I was talking to somebody who said that slot twelve thousand businesses worldwide are estimated to have been hacked by these things with a C. E. O. emails criminals a thought have got about two billion dollars from this you would expect would you John that systems at the New York federal reserve would\u0027ve been good enough to withstand the as you would expect and I think that of the good work of our colleagues in Europe on reporting this is going to result in a lot of review of how this happened because of it happened for Bangladesh one wonders who else has it happened for in other words not cannot happen again or will it happen again but where has it already happened that we just don\u0027t know this just goes to show that biggest intuitions big financial institutions are not impervious two what is it and credible global scourge at this point and that was John Makdessi associate editor of the wallstreet journal in New York and in that discussion with and they know who\u0027s capsule markets correspondent at the Financial Times in London that\u0027s all for this edition of world business report you can keep in touch by email well don\u0027t business at BBC dot co dot UK or on Twitter BBC world base from all of us here thank you for downloading from the BBC world service you can find a whole world of information from science arts business and technology just go to the BBC world service dot com slash pub because",

    "text": "this is world business report from the BBC world service on Mike Johnson Europe central bank reveals a surprise package of measures designed to breathe new life into the fracking eurozone economy but will it work monetary policy can momentarily take you out of trouble but it cannot be in the long run the basis of a sustainable growth we need structural reform also in the program a new parliament but no governments as voters tide of austerity punish the political elites in Ireland stop trump the Republican campaign to derail the property billionaires tilt for the White House the establishment Republicans are both bold and toothless they\u0027ve pulled out their hair in the gnashing their teeth and as part of the BBC\u0027s annual school report today will be hearing how a milk price crisis is forcing some British farmers out of business it\u0027s very difficult at the moment especially with people around you exiting at the rate they are extinct because there is no bright future at the moment that\u0027s all coming up over the next half an hour sign low or no growth weak consumer spending prices in the shops for me it\u0027s no economic policy right now for the nineteen countries which make up the your sign one of the European central bank has announced a new raft of measures to try to turn things around is being seen by investors a surprisingly aggressive with me in the studio to explain what is Ross mode at the investment company Asia pale how high the Russert just explain simply what is the bank will first of all it\u0027s cooked three different interest rates one of which it took deeper into negative territory some banks could have to pay more to park their cash for the European central bank increase the scope of its money printing or quantity feeding program by a third and also it\u0027s taken money printing problems it\u0027s not just a bike government bonds but also culprit bones as well to try and drive down the cost of borrowing for companies and this was seen as a pretty surprisingly dramatic move me to drive you talked about doing something for three months of people smell something coming but definitely a lot more nobody saw the increase to the constant easing program by a third and nobody saw the ball the culprit bombs coming either what she sees designed to do what he supposed at least to be the impacts on real households real business and I think in the end what is trying to do is get banks to lend more money and make more credit available to borrowers to households to companies to try and stimulate European economic growth the problem is that over the last twelve months without a loss of kiwi already and the results frankly a very very mixed inflation is no different from what was a year ago GDP growth is a little bit higher manufacturing sentiment surveys a little bit lower so it\u0027s it\u0027s there\u0027s no proof that it\u0027s the correct solution thank you for now I will be back to you later in the program to hear a little bit more about the reception investors cave to central bank announced first of all let\u0027s get some reaction from two euro zone economies Spain and Germany Spain first wet kasha bank has more customers than any other Judy go why is chief economist and what did he think of what Europe central bank at them the monetary policy that the central bank in Europe we set undertaking was justified in the beginning given the crisis year but as time goes by quantitative easing and then negative interest rates becomes already ineffective and in fact can have dangerous it makes the business models all of and he should not sustainable ugly mauled by it hurts savers it is unclear that it will promote far there are spending because people sometimes half saving targets and you are not paid for your savings you decide to you and say more the X. penalizing the creditors I guess is also hurting real profits as well these hard to top line was net interest income but of course bunks which are a very diversified provides a lot of study says he should and investment funds have other sources of revenue but the trouble is set a Florida small and medium sized firms surely though the European central bank has to do something it\u0027s trying to oil the wheels of what is a very sluggish economy in the eurozone it\u0027s trying to Stoke a little bit of inflation by trying to encourage banks like yours not to just park their money with the central bank but landed out into the real economy instead when you are at a drug bottom interest rates went up project a new investment projects undertaken or not doesn\u0027t depend on a few basis points so you have to convince investors that you will have sufficiently stable tax regime sufficiently stable regulatory regimes otherwise monetary policy is not the only instrument the banks also extended its stimulus package today your reaction to that is not something you would applaud expectations were high so they had to uglies satisfy part of the espy the market and to extend the package I think it was an appropriate moves in the debate wiring that almost whatever the central bank in Europe does doesn\u0027t seem to really be having much effect the goals of the real economy at the end of today is the result of increased productivity and that comes from the supply side from document so monetary policy can momentarily take you out of trouble but it cannot be in the long run the basis of a sustainable growth we need structural reforms that was the chief economist at the Spanish bank kaisha Jordy cool to Germany now with the economy\u0027s faring sunny better than spying there are some signs that consumers are getting nervous about spending money also fisheries chief executive of the Berlin stock exchange and he\u0027s been giving me his reaction to today\u0027s news really have people consuming more than they used in the past they are less worried to spend money that was surprising over the last year that tests slow down a little bit not a lot the reason for that is a bit unclear what certainly helps consumption is as a refugee crisis something like one point two million refugees in in Germany and via creating a lot of infrastructure for them so that also boosts consumption to some extent some people think that\u0027s authorities ought to be doing what what has been called people\u0027s quantitative easing in other words putting measures in place that time just for example benefit banks but their benefit Sir household is a and that might mean just simply I did I writing people out checks for a certain amount of money and and encouraging them to go out and spend it with that work very dangerous very dangerous one of the side effects of both the central bank is doing is if you might get into a housing bubble in Germany because money so cheap said now people are starting to apply houses because they don\u0027t want to spend the money on consumption see one invested seconde really do it conservatively in the bank\u0027s sit on one of my expertise that\u0027s a little bit too risky for them so they\u0027re going to buying houses and rent them out and there is a public building up because as soon as interest rates will go up send our people can\u0027t afford to to to pay interest so that\u0027s that\u0027s a problem giving people money in their hands without increasing production is is a very dangerous game to play I wouldn\u0027t I wouldn\u0027t do that and what was not dangerous to to give banks all the money that we\u0027ve given them good question actually and that was a different a topic we didn\u0027t give them money to bank so they could spend it on themselves for on on salaries on because we gave banks money so we and Hans a balance sheet so they wouldn\u0027t go bust that\u0027s a different thing we always tried to stop getting those kind of monies into the and a cash flow of the economy we always tried not to do that would be it but central bank is doing at the moment is central bank tries to encourage banks not just to park their money at the bank itself say one of the banks to loan the money but the banks are reluctant to loan money because have worried about the risks they take on board and this is what the central bank is fighting now what happened in Germany which I find rather interesting we have actually last year and and even this year tendencies that salaries increase speed historically have a very slow increase in salaries and that has changed to some extent that\u0027s doing what you\u0027ve Australia increase of salaries will give people more money in the pocket and suspended that is happening but it\u0027s not happening because the government is saying it is happening because everybody can see that Germany\u0027s doing well and or the workers want to participate in that grows the chief executive of the Berlin stock exchange arts who officia right now has promised to a regular market commentator rust note it\u0027s HA bell who still with me in the street addresses we first said this was something of a surprise to investors how did they react the sneeze from the central bank while the financial markets initially gave Mr Dracula response that you want to check prices went up bond yields went down and the euro went down but all of that completely reversed in the last two was a I was of trading public is Mr Draghi because he\u0027s own growth and inflation forecasts if you say we\u0027re trying more something hasn\u0027t really works over the past year and all students at at the end that may be for interest rate cuts are may not do anymore ways after previous ECB meetings he said he\u0027s always dangle the carrot of I will do whatever it takes to get the growth to get growth going so I think that since he took everybody but even further by surprise and as a result share prices she ended the day down bond yields unchanged and your ashy end of the day strong with how it started which isn\u0027t what Mister John you want to say it\u0027s all he\u0027ll want Europe to go down to try and give European exporters of competitive boost and drive growth without mechanisms are things aren\u0027t working but not of my findings bazooka no fee and if you look over the last year since kiwi was introduced the European stoxx six hundred index is stock index is down chairman bond yields are key proteome changed and he always stronger against the dollar so it doesn\u0027t seem to be having the desired effect in the financial markets and in the real world druggies because he\u0027s on inflation GDP focus again Sir again its case very very much improvement that throwing money at the problem quite literally is the solution okay and also going to talk about island in just a moment in the program but there was some eye catching news about the health of the Irish economy fourth quarter GDP growth number of nine point two percent of for a full year twenty fifteen that was ninety eight percent I accept the best there is quite low but if you looking for a case study of a country that went through a brutal austerity program and is now coming out of the other side island is it I accept that there\u0027s been emigration that rather like Latvia that was another post a child for the high school of economics the Austrian school of economics taking medicine go through this process of structural reform and you will eventually begin to get rewards and island another pop the voters aren\u0027t very happy about it but the economic numbers are starting to come through I can just like you very much indeed that was Ross mould from and here\u0027s a bell let\u0027s put some numbers on those market changes are now than the Mensheviks here in London ended the day down almost two percent at six thousand and thirty seven the Dow in New York is also low at the moment it\u0027s down no point seven percent economy stands at sixteen thousand eight hundred and eighty two on the currency markets the euro is at one dollar eleven point nine your sense that\u0027s a rise for the euro of one and a half year census that Ross was saying that and just learning about that with the pounds at one dollar forty three point one that\u0027s a rise for sterling of not point seven sensibilities slit for the oil price Cypriot light crude that Saddam seventy five cents at thirty seven point five seven dollars a barrel well in a few weeks time island is marking the centenary of the Easter Rising rebellion against British rule recently that Irish voters staged a rebellion of their own at the ballot box anger about the impact of austerity and the introduction of water charges leads to an inconclusive general election results two weeks ago the outgoing government of enda Kenny\u0027s Finnigan and its coalition labor party lost an election in which no one won an overall majority islands new parliament met for the first time today but still no sign of a new government Dimmitt Fleming reports mt dnmt understanding and more street right in the center of Dublin on beside me are the buildings for the leaders of the nineteen surrendered on lost a hundred years ago they were trying to form a government for Ireland footwear under rather more pressure them today\u0027s politicians we\u0027re trying to do the same dnmt I leann street is famed for its street markets we are stoles with an array of vegetables and fruits from all over the country and around the world it\u0027s a place where people come to strike a bargain instead of going to the supermarket so the women and men who work here know better than most as to how to strike a deal entree into nd yeah I want to you\u0027re the heart and the business here and more street doesn\u0027t bother you that there\u0027s nobody up wheelhouse of the economy I think it\u0027s actually people that\u0027s torn and economy diplomatic that store and economy also much the government and it\u0027s it\u0027s hard working people declared itself what we were in the first place do you think it makes a difference Husin government not definitely not considered a sign to bring and so now it\u0027s harness walk to charges you name it they have certain of the safe artists from my personal front they don\u0027t give a damn you know what I mean dnmt three yeah and no problem anything else sweet talk for the customers but not for the last governments the anger here not matching the praise it one internationally for steering Arlin from bailouts to the fastest growing economy in the U. her remarkable turnaround for the deeply unpopular austerity policies driving has cost the government power Chris Mooney says life is tough on the minimum wage here ends of nine euro fifteen or just over ten dollars an hour and a struggle to pay soaring rents with the housing crisis following a construction crash most people I\u0027ve spoken to have very negative attitudes towards their recent governments that we Huff and power and I I just hope that it would just going to be more on the people side on the contest content better solutions on agreements to make art and a better place to live nnat water charges brought in by the last government had to mass protests Paul Murphy member of the artists parliament for the anti austerity alliance is facing charges over one demonstration I think the water protest did two things I think one they brought home to people the real nature of the recovery which is a recovery for the rich and a continuation of a robbery of the rest on a transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top and secondly they gave an edge to the anger about that because they showed things could be different people work mobilizing on the streets were protesting and were boycotting refusing to pay for the water charges nnat no charges remain at center stage in talks over a new government syndicated stands by the book rivals fina fol say their scrap the new company artist water and suspend charges for five years forty percent of people have not pay their bills with the uncertainty meaning this figure may grow according to a survey this week dnmt listeners in central Dublin plaster my way with which way is the question everyone is asking for how our internet twenty two I can do that was deemed it Fleming reporting from now who can stop Donald Trump the billionaire property magnate\u0027s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination continues to gather momentum when it comes to his opponents the gloves are certainly coming off dnmt shop University we teach success former students say trump university was a scam costing up to thirty five thousand dollars for an unlicensed illegal school that offered no actual degrees a federal court ruled that trumps company hired illegal immigrants to help the construction process for trump tower even paid million dollar fine and his new hotel in Washington The Washington Post interviewed about fifteen laborers and the DC hotel site reporting that many revealed they had entered the U. S. illegally Republican opponents of Donald Trump of been spending big money on ads attacking him ones you just have a funded by a group called al principles political action committee supporters of Republican rival Marco Rubio now funding more anti trump hence ahead of a must win primary Mr reviews home state of Florida on Tuesday when we talk about what Sesame been an eye catching presidential the nomination campaign so far with a regular commentator Irving stone\u0027s are at the Hudson institute in Washington and I started by asking just how worried sections of the Republican Party were about the prospect of a trump victory the establishment Republicans are both bold and toothless they\u0027ve pulled out their hair in the gnashing their teeth because they have a real dilemma they don\u0027t believe trump can beat Hillary Clinton and anyhow they find him an embarrassment on the other hand if they deny him the nomination at the convention if he goes in with a plurality of delegates the try army will March out of the party and they will lose the election do you think the Republicans who do feel Donald Trump would be unelectable and that\u0027s mainly because at those celebrated plans to build a wall along the Mexican border impose a temporary ban on old Muslims entering the us is that true do you think Donald Trump would be unelectable I don\u0027t think he\u0027s unelectable for two reasons first of all the polls don\u0027t show him that much behind Hillary Clinton and second of all she\u0027s a very weak candidate she just can\u0027t seem to connect with the voters she lost to socialist Bernie Sanders in Michigan she\u0027s having a lot of trouble getting voters in the Midwest she\u0027s got an army of unmarried women who represent twenty five percent of the eligible electorate they\u0027re overwhelmingly for Mrs Clinton and African Americans who if they vote which is not at all clear because a president Obama\u0027s not at the head of the ticket give her a big edge on the other hand Mr trump has brought millions of people who have never voted before into the voting process so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s certain that trump would lose to of Mrs Clinton but I think what is certain is that the Republican Party as we have understood it free trade polite feet wasabi party will never be the same if trump is the nominee rights because he\u0027s got some pretty transient views on on China as well he\u0027s proposed new tariffs on imports from China that\u0027s very much anti free trade how appealing it a message is that you seem to American voters well protectionism is the idea of the day in both parties the days of my America being enormously for free trade at least its political class is over trump says he\u0027s a free trader he just wants to negotiate better than the morons on our side who have been negotiating deals Mrs Clinton is against the trans Pacific trade deal the mass of the Democratic Party in the Congress is against it we are now I protectionist country for all intents and purposes we have to point out the Donald Trump seems to be striking a slightly more conciliatory notes in recent days dozens he I guess he could just of course be the decent like his radical in office if you ever get sent far as he has been on the campaign trail it would be the first time for politicians remember he doesn have deep ideological convictions so it\u0027s easier for him to to change his position and in fact he\u0027s given a sort of long talk defending changing your position and you know that\u0027s in the great tradition of John Maynard Keynes when the facts change I change my positions what do you do Sir so that\u0027s in it but but basically it\u0027s a fact of life in America that the founding fathers were brilliant and constrain the ability of the president to do exactly as he pleases when he pleases were not a parliamentary system the president can\u0027t announce a budget like your chancellor for example can announce a budget he can\u0027t make trade deals are not make trade hills the thoughts that of the US economist Irwin styles are at the Hudson institute in Washington just remind you listen to the BBC world service the world\u0027s radio station and it\u0027s a very special good evening if you happen to be listening to us on digital short wave old DRM in India on five point eight four five Meg now it Sir PPC school reports today that stain the effort in when we throw open our doors to eleven to sixteen year olds and given the chance to create their own news reports about subjects important to them here in the UK dairy farming is **** a crossroads increase supply and sluggish demand on presenting some big challenges no prices have fallen and many dairy farms are going out of business soap for this year\u0027s school reports we can hear from a group of young people from a village that has given its name to one of the world\u0027s most famous cheeses Chad in southwest England his their reports on how the milk price crisis is affecting young people\u0027s price and in March twenty fifteen we the kings and queens news team investigates the falling prices paid farmers for them out over the last twelve months however things have gone from bad to worse with the average price police page dropping from twenty three point seven one pence litre to fifteen pence litre over the last year which led to many farmers selling up and leaving the industry into right complaints about because in them so they can only see another account respect local dairy farm and actress Jane thought has played a big part in the campaign for a fair price in the performance over the past few years how do you see or a dairy farm in the next ten years to thing is going to grow is again a good small display completely I\u0027m twenty nine years old I\u0027m so third generation working on this from whistle tenth generation in this area farming personnel like to see a very prosperous and vibrant future for this farm you know entitled to produce milk just because your family is pretty smoke you need to make sure that you are producing milk so that a business can operate we are not we are farmers that\u0027s a hundred percent correct but we also have to be businessmen and making sure that we make the correct business decisions that is sustainable for our own businesses and our own

that with the BBC\u0027s Martin patience in the financial capital likes well there\u0027s been an attraction on under wolves are point line in this apartment close to one of the country\u0027s biggest export terminals it\u0027s not clear who carried out thats acabou appears to be the cases and according to reports it could take two months to repair this pipeline which will put a dent in Nigeria\u0027s oil exports by about ten percent I think a big fear is that we\u0027ll see renewed militancy in the delta region and that cop production enhance a decade or so ago when the violence was at its height and this is at a time when Nigeria is already suffering with much reduced income because of the lower oil price just tell us about the effect that had on the economy and and particularly the currency the naira more than only rest on the real prank sure there\u0027s a huge amount of volatility you\u0027re goin points you have been known to eat percent of Nigeria\u0027s foreign currency earnings come from oil unease global slump in prices means does last dollars in the government coffers they get about two thirds of the Raton you from mass on what was seen he\u0027s a mad scramble on the black market for people and companies trying to get dollars I suits making it very very difficult there\u0027s a huge discrepancy between official race I\u0027m not black market rates and dollars about fifty percent or so you know of course we got a point other manufacturers who who want to import materials except for that they need dollars that they say manufactures under our another sector of the economy that needs foreign currency that\u0027s totally wrong I spoke to one manufacturing he was having problems getting parts in for machinery has bought another businessman who says look if I can get my hands and dollars my business he\u0027s going to go to go to the wall of what what they the government is done is since last summer it\u0027s introduced measures capital controls are to trying to stem the flow of dollars out of the country how is all of this affecting ordinary people on one level it\u0027s it\u0027s quite an abstract macro economic story about foreign exchange reserves at central what does it mean for the people of Nigeria well I before ordinary people for stop but there\u0027s rising inflation it\u0027s about ten percent if you\u0027re doing business it\u0027s very difficult to get imports into the country Anand met many of the middle classes are are up in arms because they\u0027re struggling to get cash to pay for their kids educations overseas and I spoke to one mother whose son is starting at a university in the UK and she told me that the system was raped a lot of this people in government they have children approached and they will have this program doesn\u0027t house of assembly those in the Senate then definitely to have this problem influences the precedent that the vice president bill will have this program festival there only will go through the bouquet seal we seen to get there if you cannot prove that\u0027s one all even if they have to buy as a pilot market become with a forty five so this good have just seen and that\u0027s what everybody stuck I made that they want to act out the middle class the thoughts of one mother that in legos so what about the future than it is the Nigerian government going to resist all of this pressure from the international community from the likes of the IMF to devalue the naira and loosen these restrictions on foreign currency holdings on on foreign currency is are they going to stand firm on that do you think well I I mean I spoke to one top official he says yes we are going to stand firm he says devaluing will get us nowhere what we need to seize financial discipline within the Nigerian economy also spoke about his being an opportunity for knowledge here analogy is a country which imports almost everything it doesn\u0027t really have a minor fracturing base and he says this is an opportunity for knowledge earrings to make things that Nigerians knees not doing business here he\u0027s incredibly tough and some economists are warning that was slowing slowing growth potentially the country could face an economic disaster the government doesn\u0027t think that\u0027s the case but the real strains here and it still isn\u0027t clear exactly what\u0027s going to happen the disease mouse in patient speaking to me from like us was faint glimmer of hope for countries like Nigeria which rely so heavily on selling oil the cost of crude has continued to recent modest climb however only international markets over the past few hours free speech emits IG markets joins me live Chris the global a benchmark Brent crude moved back about forty dollars a barrel today what was behind that it is a bit about day after crudo we had two things really push this up was we had a American stockpile data which alert should another big built in overall crystal posted show a mashup drop in gasoline are inventors say assumption is the demand in the US is improving as one of the biggest consumers of all that would be a bullish sign on it we expect for the demand to improve to push prices up plus we had expectations or size a hope limo pick meeting in March might agree to further production freezes Abbas going some way to help in dealing with this massive oversupply we have include markets at the moment order which helped push as in energy companies Howard I think on both sides of the Atlantic in Europe and the U. S. today yes you will see that come about this but when you have a rise in crude oil prices so that does help stock markets to reserve regain some of that poise rice elsewhere two of the world\u0027s biggest banks have been told that they have to pay taxes on bonuses tell us a bit about that we keep finding scandals in banking sector has a fairly minor one of course and spirit creative accounting really to keep for bonuses with and the tax payable at down to a relatively small level and at the core was ruled by CBS and torture them caught me do that and have to pay at the tax back safe in the context of the bigger scandals we\u0027ve had policies it\u0027s nothing too major beta Swisher that can help sector is still taking quite a long time right Kris thank you very much indeed that was crispy commit RG markets joining us life the main share index here in London and you the day out per modesty about a third of a percent six thousand one hundred forty six the Dow New York that\u0027s also up a third of a percent stands at seventeen thousand and twenty one currencies the yours at one dollar ten point to your sense and the pound is trading at one dollar forty two point you\u0027re listening to World business report from the BBC world service still to come nndb nndb being how the technical innovation of fifth Beatle George Martin helped transform than you first though when the motor car went into mass production in the first half of the twentieth century it was seen as the ultimate symbol of freedom and progress today though many of the world\u0027s biggest cities are struggling to cope with the number of cars on the streets the Indian capital Delhi for example the most polluted city on the planet according to the World Health Organization the engine government\u0027s been trying to restrict car use with a number of measures including a new tax the BBC show excellent my reports now from daily on the impacts because having on people\u0027s health uhhuh dnmt eighth so I don\u0027t really how dare vannatter it\u0027s nearly bedtime at the Mahajan household and five year old Cairo us parents are getting had to say a prayer she\u0027s been taught at school she has on a pink tee shirt and pajamas but before she goes off to sleep she has to take a medicine treat the CBO cough she\u0027s been suffering from it\u0027s not your regular medicine fineness Kyra has to wear a mosque attached to a machine vaporizes the drugs so that they can be released directly into her lungs and she has to do this for fifteen minutes twice a day mean reason doctor puts this on is because of the pollution in the air kairos mother anomie cuddles me she thinks the problem is getting worse repetition level seems to be rising so with every passing gill the intensity of the cost has gone up I\u0027ve only gone to much to control it shouldnt Jenny\u0027s day is the worst in the world according to the WB two or the World Health Organization and the pollution is often visible usually when the sun rises and sets cloud of smoke hangs over the city as a major road junction in Delhi a traffic jam extends to where I can see I can smell the smoke in the air and as I breathe in the back of my throat feels a little bit scratchy now pollution in this city at its peak can be twenty five times more toxic than the safe level sex by the World Health Organization and why they\u0027re all different sources of pollution here scientific studies have shown that forty five percent of the most harmful pollutants come from car emissions and that\u0027s not the only reason they\u0027re so dangerous says enemy that Roy joy to read from center for science and environment it is a public health standpoint what matters most is your proximity to the social pollution city may have many sources of pollution but on a daily basis what you\u0027re most exposed to the toxic fumes coming out of the tailpipes of vehicles regular on their short and when you live close to the real site studies have shown that in Delhi if this fifty five to sixty percent of the U. seventeen million people live within five hundred meters from the north side riches under the guise it it\u0027s a zoo uncritically the British the government has been trying to put curbs only Jesus because of the city the public transport is insufficient nnj spilled into what else Daddy\u0027s mean station in the past year to try to get on it excuse already quite long it is rush off is that right people pushed around a bit jumpsuit that I am in the best hardly any place there just people don\u0027t around stories yeah no trains have been promised and Delhi minister suck danger Jen tells me they\u0027re working furiously to build transport infrastructure don\u0027t neglect your head exiled him in one year sixty percent of did even live within half a kilometer of a metro station and in the next three years we\u0027ve really expect to expand public transport more substantially dnmt it\u0027s only been begun to sink in that a crisis is hanging over the city people and this has moved instant solution that was your discipline my reporting from dead heat so is the world getting any better at controlling the number of calls checking its biggest cities I\u0027ll seal stings executive director of the Brussels based system and will transport think tank transport and environment if you look at London Stockholm Amsterdam to Copenhagen to tactics there be backbone is making it more difficult to get a more expensive to get round so romanised on a congestion charge Stockholm is going to get a congestion tax I\u0027m semi Copenhagen work with very high parking charges it\u0027s just a very expensive so if you caught me in the city so you think twice and how successful of those kinds of things being these moves have been have been very successful that the spy cam Saddam for example being a very rich city with plenty of people capable financially of owning a car car ownership is the lowest and the entire country so people just opt not to have one because it\u0027s too inconvenient and also of course because the alternatives are very convenient people are never happy with the prospect of having to pay but what was previously for free and they don\u0027t know what they\u0027re going to cats but afterwards they see what they\u0027re going to get you know they\u0027re going to get much more livable cities to going to get better alternative much more space nobody can two walk safer better equality and last but not least less congestion so essentially you you get around much faster much a people\u0027s when people have seen that they start endorsing these schemes that are initially considered draconian and big numbers we\u0027ve been hearing about the health impacts of pollution from cars in a city like daily and I know that at the beginning of this year the authorities there move to a system where you are any less in vehicles without number plates on one day and vehicles with even number place on another is a system like that like you to be effective do you think well we much prefer systems that actually tackled upon of the vehicle if you have the alt even numbers time which families can Carson drive one the one they but they so it\u0027s much better to say if you have a old polluting car then you your access to the center is denied or at the very least a severely restricted that\u0027s the kind of political signal and that we need to people shift to cars that are and bacteria far less right so how impressed are you by efforts have been to make calls cleaner electric cars Hodgen because not the see that many of them out on the roads but some is that going to be part of the solution I think the big challenge for Europe at this point is to get off its diesel addiction which nobody else is following and move to an electric vehicle based industry as quickly as possible if we don\u0027t do it Silicon Valley in China will overtake us last year China sold three hundred thousand electric vehicles we all know what apple and Google and test lyra to and meanwhile we are asleep at the wheel sting\u0027s at the stable trample think tank transport and environment he was speaking to be from Brussels now you can\u0027t see it you can\u0027t smell it but radon gas is a silent killer radon is released steadily as uranium decays also cause for concern if you happen to live in a part of the world where the rocks are rich in that uranium southern Finland is one such place from where the BBC\u0027s Edwin lane reports I\u0027m just outside the city of Tampa day here in southern Finland I\u0027m walking through some pretty no along with talk of an esca a large ridge of rock and soil left over from the glasses that used to cover large parts of this country until the end of the last ice age and its ridges like these that I found across southern Finland that can cause a bit of a problem because they\u0027re rich in rock and soil that emits a lots of naturally occurring radon now it is in the atmosphere is not too much of a problem but what it tends to do is see incipio\u0027s houses through the foundations from the rock underneath and that causes some potentially serious health problems I love in finance nnj a my name is Marcus here along I work us building monitor for the city of dumb better we Mister around two to three hundred buildings every winter market shows me around a local school where the ventilation system has been installed specifically to stop right on accumulating just come down into the basement talk us through what\u0027s happening here this loss of big metal pipes where is the radon gas coming from as we speak and where is it going it it\u0027s collected under the building here on the roof we have two fans had pipes go under the building this building is actually pretty well done the fins of known about the raid on admitting rocks for decades but it\u0027s not just felons geology that\u0027s the problem it\u0027s also the weather one of the things you really notice when you visit Finland is how warm it feels indoors even in the middle of winter I\u0027m in my hotel room at the moment looking at the thermostats in the wall it says about twenty degrees Celsius and thus despite the fact that if I walk out on my balcony it\u0027s absolutely freezing out here it\u0027s about minus tool minus three at the moment but it can get as low as minus thirty degrees Celsius in the depths of winter and that temperature differences because buildings here in Finland a really well designed it keeping the he thin and the cold ounce now that\u0027s great for dealing with the winter weather and keeping your energy bills down but it\u0027s a problem when it comes to raid on duty that goal climates Dunton temperature difference especially in winter time so it creates a make up the pressure into the house only home grin is from the radiation and nuclear safety authority this negative press I\u0027ve sucks air from the ground and this is a test high radon concentrations and so it\u0027s only a really small air volumes it\u0027s enough to cause higher grade elements inside and it\u0027s when you expose people to high levels of radon over a long period of time that you start to see the health problems that by far most important health impact of radon is to increase risk of lung cancer and see Oberlin is professor of epidemiology at the university of Tampa in Finland we have a total of about two thousand lung cancer cases and nearly and it\u0027s been estimated that about five to ten percent of those cases would be attributable to raid on so we\u0027re talking about one hundred fifty lung cancer cases and you know back at the school inspectors like Marcus appear to have Finland\u0027s radon problem under control but the health effects of likely to show up for decades to come that report from Edwin lane in Finland they became the biggest selling music artists of all time box when the Beatles first met their producer he was none too impressed I think my music was not very good songs are pretty amateurish I was on the point of turning down except that I actually was in the studio with them for an hour and now charisma that made me feel good that that quality which is rare in that when you\u0027re with him you\u0027re happy and when you go you feel a little bit lost the voice that of George Martin who\u0027s died at the age of nineteen he produced almost all the albums the Beatles night he was a worked for the likes of sting Celine Dion the rolling stones and Elton John many believe George Martin had a profound impact on the music business among them the British television director and producer Francis Hanley he met George Martin for a BBC documentary about his life in twenty twelve I think George earned the Beatles impact on the music business is incalculable Jordan because revolutionize what you did in the studio he stops trying to correct hates with light sound wasn\u0027t like taking a snapshot of a live band it was crate sink this multi layered musical extravaganza and everyone who goes into the studio I was attacked what they did multi tracking sort of layering the mixture of classical music popular music different instrumentation I do even some sound effects and bringing in sort of found material I\u0027m desert there\u0027s a track cool revolution number nine where they just went into into the sort of the depths of Abbey Road that found a sort of and instructional tape I think the French language type there was lesson number nine and they just took phenomenon in the late repeated at number nine number nine dnmt number nine nnj most was quite tech savvy wasn\u0027t he but for the time it was army was interesting also audio technology mark finds when you place them how you sort of arrange things in the studio when I was with us what you really want to in life is how to design aircraft you know you have that sort of stuff giddiness which I think a great purchases have to have have to be in love with the technology to be able to utilize on this issue of multi track recording to produce the lead sound that was something he he really brought to the music industry at the time wasn\u0027t it heated and it was fantastic difficult but it wasn\u0027t you know you didn\u0027t have signaled tricky sort of inventive just by using you know of flying Troxel is different tape recorders and that on tomorrow never knows had sort of like eight sleeps all beings ball going assigned rainn he had a classic didn\u0027t he went to the Guildhall school of music here in London he became a pro actional oboe player did that classical influence make yourself felt in the music he went on to produce it did I mean he was always offering thats depth of experience to the Beatles and this is why they were a marriage made in heaven because I just wanted to use any method they could to push things five they were offering George is the perfect man to office and two he could orchestrates he could suggest I mean just interesting on Elena Rick Perry strings he was sort of like he was her will give a listen to the infield music as a planet Herman and you\u0027re the guy who did sort of psycho wins and lot of Hitchcock films isa play the violin without vibrato play very harsh and that sound again it revolutionized pop music and in a way it sort of fed buckets classical music dictate revitalized husky hello so far I assume nnj Blitzer dnmt sn I think the Beatles would have actually been a success were they not to have met George Martin the patrons were debating success however projects leading the company blueprints of two of the greatest song writers you know we will have a say but my cousin Vinny Threepwood nipping as radical actors interesting and they wouldn\u0027t of flour it in the same way that they did it without George Martin after the Beatles he could sort a pick and choose who he works with and it\u0027s an eclectic bunch but interesting none the less and he just you know he would do things for fun Elton John beach boys culture club and many of the biggest names in in popular music the list goes on unserem he never stood still he was always sort of trying to do different things and trying to work to I missed immensely get people to do things for them wouldn\u0027t necessary if done for anyone else nnj I\u0027m nndb that was the British television director and producer Francis handy arms George Martina whose dies past the age and I will leave it to the fab four who else to take us to the end of the program explicitly moments and nbsp I still can\u0027t thank all and humn pn nnj mt I love all the nndb thank you for listening to this pub because from the the world service for more download businessman the big stories and trends of the day discussed by contributors in Asia and North America I

    "text": "this is world business report from the BBC world service I\u0027m Susanna\u0027s Theresa Bangladesh claims that its account at the New York federal reserve is being hacked we haven\u0027t gotten to the bottom of the story all the New York fed is saying is that their systems have not been breached that doesn\u0027t mean there could have been a hacking from China or somewhere else downward spiral of prices in Zimbabwe why deflation is bringing the economy to a standstill I\u0027m struck by a limited activity **** Baeza empty and most supermarkets Anuj busy is the use and on international women\u0027s day what should businesses due to enable more mothers to stay in their careers fifty percent of the world\u0027s brains are in a hundred percent of the world\u0027s women if we keep women out of the workforce are they raise their family they can get back to the workforce so we need to make it possible for them to raise their families at the same time that\u0027s all coming up that fast it\u0027s a mystery bank heist thought to involve hackers and laundered money and it\u0027s apparently taken place at the New York federal reserve the institution which processes transactions for the main U. S. central bank Bangladesh\u0027s central bank claimed on Monday its U. S. accountability access to money being stolen from it but the bank in New York has denied it systems were breached get Bangladeshi authorities claim some of the money is being traced to the Philippines and that working with anti money laundering office is that it\u0027s not known how much money is cool missing but one report suggested it could be up to one hundred million dollars but that\u0027s just one of the mystery surrounding the affair as John Coffey from Columbia Law School explain your federal reserve is probably the largest banking operation in the world it does the actual transfer of funds for the federal reserve and it\u0027s the largest such bank in the Federal Reserve System and it has presumably state of the art security I\u0027m not suggesting that nothing could go wrong but they\u0027d be a hard nut to crack your fire were a factor in China looking at the easiest way to get into forms none the less Bangladesh claims that its accounts at the federal reserve was hacks in the money was stolen did the central bank has been pretty vociferous and say you know this is what\u0027s happened yes the New York federal reserve has denied it systems were breached it seems as though one of the other is telling the truth we haven\u0027t gotten to the bottom of the story all the New York fed is saying is that their systems have not been breached and there\u0027s been no break down in their security that doesn\u0027t mean there couldn\u0027t of been a hacking from China or somewhere else but it does raise the tantalizing possibility that the Chinese hacker was a cover story and there is even a possibility that this could be a so called inside job with the hackers being used as simply the excuse central bank in Bangladesh says this is working with anti money laundering authorities in the Philippines what some of these funds have ended up well it could well be that they\u0027ve ended up in the Philippines and that wouldn\u0027t be a surprising destination if I were in the business of money laundering at doesn\u0027t mean how they got there or that they started buying of actually went directly to the Philippines or what we want and some other method possibly with there being unauthorized withdrawal from the federal reserve and then a diversion of those forms we just haven\u0027t gone anywhere near the bottom of the story and it\u0027s a little early to try to point fingers of blame just dumb how many foreign central banks use this New York based institution simply because the dollar is basically the world\u0027s reserve currency they all would use the New York fed unless they were barred by sanctions okay so maintenance and safety at least would decide countries I don\u0027t know two hundred thirty but certainly over two hundred and anyone who uses the dollar is likely to come through the ferret because they have the largest reserves many cases of this kind before not come to my attention I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s come to light that the fed has been hacked well that was good John Coffey from Columbia Law School Zimbabwe used to be gripped by hyper inflation but knows any longer in fact instead deflation is the cpaexcel wounding the economy at the moment prices are in a downward spiral and in the absence of a sovereign currency government multi policy is severely restricted more money copy pumped into the economy through quantitative easing that we\u0027ve seen in Europe or Japan for example both the cost of goods and demand falling economic activity is dropping off as the BBC\u0027s brown hungry reports now from the capital Harare deflation creatine Sirius viability challenges companies many a downsizing or shutting down all together you\u0027re running if the research how difficult is the current situation how difficult is it to operate under such condition quite quite normal activity in the in the customizing inadvertent many people come how to be postmarked lazy sort of a consumer demands yes No consumption happening at the moment but you\u0027ve been in the business or the seven what is this little ailments investment which in all of these things will be super such as you can see it\u0027s an investment I don\u0027t listen to business district was a hive of business activity in the past years fifteen hundred hours here in that area up walking through the central business district I\u0027m struck by limited activity **** Baeza empty and most supermarkets hundreds busy as they used to be in the past years stills one interesting thing to purchasing power is diminishing Zimbabwe\u0027s deflationary spiral is leading to a decrease in prices which is lowered production wages and demand reaching for the decreases in prices the United Nations estimates that more than seventy percent of the population or fourteen million leave or less than two dollars a day dnmt districts move the money vouchers used to be big business but still Zubin going down sees run directed into what is in the central business district people buying a temperatures now is compared to see about three years ago and what would be the problem if you it\u0027s different long time

get the twenty twenty five that\u0027s the perfect I used to get very beautifully where did you grow so the civility here in this state we are not getting anything some local students as clients oblivion shopping purchasing power liquidity challenges include production it is difficult though it is very tough what what what was many legends a coalition at the moment by god\u0027s grace is just trying to make ends meet I believe so but it\u0027s I don\u0027t know what\u0027s gonna sixteen isn\u0027t so forth but nothing is moving at the moment electricity feet I find it very difficult to cope put food on the table to be able to buy items the basic items for my family irrespective of them being available in the market it\u0027s a tight situation and needs you end up resorting to difficult and desperate measures such as buying from across the borders when the purchasing power is a bit strong dnmt he could only see the history huge injection of the economy students across the central bank saved more than half a billion is Dulles was externalized debate individuals at one point two billion bay films with the country\u0027s exports only in the country two point five billion is doulas well impossible five point five billion the huge trade deficit is likely to remain when the production goes down and that was going home great reporting well Diana games is the C. E. O. of current work and a fellow at the university of Pretoria\u0027s Gordon institute of business science she told me more about the root causes of deflation in Zimbabwe generally it is about the economy is in trouble is being long period of political uncertainty about the investment climate whether the government is going to crack down on investors are already implemented its indigenous Haitian law which said at the time and that fifty one percent of companies must be a go to Zimbabweans and that really put off a lot of investors they\u0027ve since reform that\u0027s flashy but they call him he\u0027s in deep trouble I mean there\u0027s a huge unemployment a lot of businesses are closing is just a very little time on the economy is really slow down so it doesn\u0027t have its own sovereign currency at the moment to what extent has the use of the dollar and other currencies will be attempted use impacted further on the deflationary spiral well I think the fact that they can print money of course the ability to print money was one of the issues that led to the huge hyper inflation it\u0027s about we head but at this stage they unable to control a monetary policy effectively because they\u0027ve already got what they\u0027ve got in circulation more than it has unless it is mostly the U. S. started Sir is I think that you know basically they they just conference money to have to find another way of getting money into the country could more money be available from the International Monetary Fund in the form of loans was adobe has had quite a lot of debt relief from from an organization such as the African Development Bank it is about ten billion dollars slim date and that is one of the reasons that I think the IMF is reluctant at this stage to peps rush back in because that you\u0027re somehow that it needs to be kid and I think that audiences lobby government would be reluctant pets to meet the kind of conditions that I wish would expect because they\u0027ll very strong on political sovereignty and has been quite anti what they see is developed country organization such as I am if in the pot Zimbabwe\u0027s all self reliant on mining obviously there commodities rouses hates the country pretty hard yes the government is hoping isn\u0027t it to take more money out of that industry well I think the cash the mining industry\u0027s been a cash cow for the Zimbabwe government for a very long time the mining companies have mostly stayed and now now you have a situation where the president has effectively taken back the mining rights of of the six or seven diamond mines in Zimbabwe because their licenses haven\u0027t been renewed and the government said that the diamond mines are not contributing to the government in line with the production so this court cases coming up effective yet it is a kind of nationalization of a sort but critics say that actually designs that the resources are actually declining and the government has not really made the most of their resources while they had them and you know there there\u0027s always worries that the platinum very lucrative patent mining sector might be targeted the gold mining sick takes a tracer you know the mining sector has always been very much on the government\u0027s radar when it comes to you ways of generating revenues and that was down a game CEO of maka housework it\u0027s time now to check in with the financial markets and we can speak semi car whose investment director at fidelity international hello that I think so we\u0027ve had a sharp decline in exports in China what impact was that ana the financial markets well then picked his client brief despite the dramatic slump in exports exports falling twenty five point four percent in February now that is a slightly distorted figure because remember we had the weeklong Chinese New Year holiday and Fabry Richmond closed factories and Shipman scooped so it was an unflattering buys full comparison how eva and the Chinese growth is not supposed to be based on exports we know that this is an economy transitioning from export driven growth infrastructure late June driven growth to domestic demand drive is what it is a reflection of how if it is weak external Dimond the main reason for those weak exports is that international demand is falling and that is quite concerning our what\u0027s happened with the price of oil because over the last few days it was steadily rising any change today it has been very interesting because yesterday I was who will both by my benchmarks force of brain create which is the global benchmark and West Texas it intermediate crude rising pause the forty dollar a barrel and mark for the first time victory in months and hopes really spike that the twenty month price rock was coming to an end there were two reasons for this one for English production and talks between Saudi Arabia and Russia but a cotton production to die investment bank Goldman Sachs report cold water on those hopes saying that the rally in oil was premature and unsustainable and was back below forty dollars a barrel became Kerry thank you very much for giving us that update on today\u0027s move is on the markets that we give you some of the latest numbers now and in London the one hundred share index is down point nine percent at sixty one twenty five and in New York the Dow was down point two percent at seventy thousand and thirty nine now Betty Sanders and Donald Trump of Ben\u0027s winning votes in the American primaries own platforms of protectionism setting up high tariff barriers and breaking up trade agreements to safeguard jobs and both have their sights set on destroying what they called corporate cronyism I campaigns of one huge support to the surprise of the political elites in both the Republican and the democratic parties I talked to Roger Bootle managing director of capital economics and asked him what the consequences of that policies might be for the US economy I think there are some key things in common between Bernie Sanders and don\u0027t trump particular they gotta protectionism and also the role of the mega rich on wallstreet people who have done extremely well out of the existing system however if you then dive down a bit more deeply then I think you\u0027ll find that some big differences with regard to tax for instance if we got Bernie Sanders in power which I think is highly unlikely then he would presumably want to raise tax rates considerably not just on the super rich where they might be someone actually common ground with Donald Trump but more generally Bristol trump is talking about quite radical tax cuts varies a real difference between the Republican and the Democrats as far as these two candidates a consultant I suppose you could say that this is a sign of a healthy political system actually by contrast with what been true in Britain for many many years and I see many countries in Europe others a real debate going on with some really strange however I think both of them frankly tease a technical term are off the wall vases full expenditure increases the pearly Sanders wants to push through would require some hefty increases in taxes which would then I think his incentives quite heavily meanwhile for don\u0027t trump it\u0027s back to the old imaginary world filled measure Republican world if you cut taxes tomorrow much you cut taxes the review rolls in and eventually you end up getting in more tax than you started with well is a point at which that may work but frankly I think not on the skeletal trumps talking and Tampa it also seems to be running pretty full throttle on an anti immigration platform in a real protectionist platform well if we\u0027ve got this sort of policy introduced I think it would potentially be extremely damaging and not just in America because it could set off a protectionist war across the world is one thing we know about Donald Trump it surely that if he were to gain power he wouldn\u0027t be implementing what he\u0027s been talking about over the last several months he count is balmy once he\u0027s got that nomination I fully expect him actually to take back to the more reasonable level of expectation hold try to garner votes from the center so I think one shouldn\u0027t take too seriously many of the things that she\u0027s been saying so far do you think that this attack on crony America crony corporate America will continue from both trump and as well Saunders is concerned in the the next few primaries up against Hillary Clinton I hope that it will continue in the sense that I think is very healthy one of them major failings of the capitalist system not just in America but in lots of other countries in recent years has been the ludicrously high level of rewards earned by various corporate executives not just tumble streets or in the city but actually the corporate sector more generally without I think any fundamental justification so anything that would address that is healthy whether actually moving could reasonably be down with all the usual precious I very much doubt refer start if we go to Hillary Clinton presidency and it\u0027s still likely that the Republicans will control both houses of Congress in which case it\u0027s a recipe for a stalemate and I doubt very much in those seconds the great too could be achieved is that of economista Recep it\u0027ll you\u0027re listening to the BBC world service the

expertise to improve the lives of girls in parts of Africa and Asia I talk to Rebecca colder from spring and she told me more about the programs work I think girls aspirations have changed because I think they\u0027re more aware of what the opportunities are there are out there for them and so I think it\u0027s a it\u0027s a case of of understanding what girls aspirations are and how they\u0027re involving and supporting them to achieve those aspirations what do you do as part of the spring accelerated program to help them do just that I\u0027m we support businesses in East Africa and were about to him launch in South Asia and we support businesses that have the potential to change girls lives I\u0027m either through reaching grosses customers are beneficiaries or there including girls I\u0027m in their value chains as managers running microphones highs is a sales agents or is actually producing goods and services and I think we can hear from a number of the girls and young women who have been part of the accelerated program in Uganda right now leann rimes firm control throughout the life skills lessons reproductive business skills we taught them how to see learn how to speak for themselves my name is more lucrative I\u0027m sixteen years old taping sailor maybe definitely has again beautiful feel great until cellular phone eighteen years old animal shelter manager of religion and the best things online market any customer care record keeping seems if I get to know that everything I know the soap off and I\u0027ll be a dismissal so Rebecca unknown of inspiration that coming from those girls and a lot of aspiration but still two hundred and fifty million adolescent girls live in poverty worldwide what kind of challenges do they face as they\u0027re born as a girl into a family they start facing the challenges of of not getting preferential treatment in the Homeboys are often preferred in terms of accessing health care in terms of feeding practices in terms of education you know and I say as they you know approach adolescence there\u0027s a hole in a range of different different challenges that they have to face around just staying in school arm around having to do way more work in the household than their brothers do I\u0027m early marriage early childbearing so that by the time they get to nineteen as the transitioning into womanhood they faced a huge range of different all obstacles which have knocked them back in life how important is it for the girls that you work with that they have role models to follow it\u0027s it\u0027s really important and it\u0027s a really difficult difficult thing to program around you know girls are getting inspiration from can or can\u0027t get inspiration from a whole range of different sources in everything from sort of friends and older sister stuff other women in the community who\u0027ve started businesses or who pursued their education and you can also doing sort of more formal ways through actual mentorship programs you know things around like that what the girl guides do which is providing a safe space for girls and mentors and a really good life skills curriculum that\u0027s also a really important way to reach girls and that was Rebecca colder from the spring organization one woman viewed as a role model in terms of professional achievement is lady Barbara judge she\u0027s currently the chairman of the UK\u0027s institute for directors and as an adviser to the board of tech co the Tokyo electric power company aisles Ty wet her work ethic came from really it\u0027s all about my mother when I was young when I think when everybody\u0027s young they always ask little children what you want to be when you grow up so when I came home saying I want to be an actress my mother said we are not having any starving actresses in this family if you want to act you can often for the jury going be a lawyer now my mother was really interesting woman because in the fifties she taught a course at NYU called the world of work for women and what did she teach the women in the fifties she taught them to wear white gloves which meant dress appropriately write a CV which nobody ever heard of in those days and answer the ads even though they said man walked because her theory was that at the end of the day a man looking for somebody to work for them and seen so many boring and not so smart man and find one smart women he\u0027d hire you had your mother\u0027s voice in your area giving you that work ethic if young women don\u0027t have that where else can they get that inspiration from one of the reasons I talk to young women whenever people ask me to is because I think all of us who are older and have been through it we owe it to young people to be role models to talk to them to try to inspire them to be the best that they can be somebody has to tell them it\u0027s possible how did you manage to achieve such professional success and raise a family as well because that is a real struggle it is a real struggle I think two things were lucky for me and my mother who was there again saying suicide he told you had to be there from when the baby is born to the age of one to three it was important for the baby I mother tell me it wasn\u0027t didn\u0027t matter that if I wanted to keep working that when a baby was born it needed to be fed diapered and based and you can get an eighteen year old girl to do that your job is to get a good one go and work and make the money and I said but mom if I can eighteen on call to do that the baby will think that she\u0027s the mother my mother said no Barbara a baby doesn\u0027t forget their mother it\u0027s just one more person to live what you have to do is when you are with your child be there a hundred percent of the time undivided attention but it doesn\u0027t have to be there all the time the world is changed a lot and it\u0027s hard to get childcare harder than when I was young actually that the government and employers have to help it\u0027s this point we have to have a policy starting from the top providing good childcare providing flexible working providing tax incentives that help mothers who have to pay for who have to work and pay for childcare my own opinion is that childcare should be tax deductible just deductible against your income so that you can go to work because society cannot afford to lose its smart women the childcare we have subsiding needs all that brainpower you know fifty percent of the world\u0027s brains are in a hundred percent of the world\u0027s women if we keep women out of the workforce for five or ten years while they raise their family they can get back to the workforce so we need to keep them in it and make it possible for them to raise their families at the same time and the helper like my mother was a helper to me in terms of giving me the I\u0027m emotional security to have my child be with of helper is that the government and the companies have to me be like my mother and say it\u0027s fine to work from home technology so different from when I was young you can sit at your desk at home with your child right next to you and be participating in a conference call and nobody knows where you are and that was lady Barbara judge that his also held the positions of commission at the securities and exchange commission in the U. S. and the head of the UK\u0027s atomic energy you\u0027ve been listening to world business report on the BBC world service with me Susanna\u0027s Teresa if you went to comment on anything email us well talk business happy BC talk to you can thank you for listening to this pub because from the BBC world service for more download business matters well the big stories and trends of the day are discussed by contributors in Asia and North America you can listen to its over breakfast or on your way to work fineness ",

leaders turning a blind eye to Turkey\u0027s crackdown on the media Turkey has Europe over a barrel right now the overwhelming politically Xing your price now is a refugee crisis and the only way to get those numbers to it\u0027s a strike a deal Turkey Beijing says that won\u0027t be a hard landing as it unveils a new lower growth target but just how reliable on its numbers is a gap between I think what\u0027s happening on the ground and what the government says it\u0027s happening in it and its figures unfortunate because they continue to set hi growth targets that gap I think will assist and you\u0027ve got mail the inventor of the apt symbol has dies we find out how is who began in nineteen seventy one I was busily trying to find things to use this new fangled network for night heard about a proposal to send messages to be printed with the printer and stuffed away in mailboxes for people to read and you can have more of that archive interview with email Pinay ray Tomlinson coming up that fast Turkey\u0027s over the European Union more help in stemming the flood of refugees but it wants more money and fast track accession talks in return discussions of being taking place among EU leaders in Brussels where prime is stuck up at davuto lu said Ankara would take back all non Syrian migrants and crackdown Honda when people smugglers that it wants concessions in return including quick a visa free travel for its citizens Herkules for Europe\u0027s leaders to strike a much harder bargain and speak out against on car is increasingly authoritarian behavior the criticism has intensified the Turkish authorities seized the control of design on newspaper lace on Friday jealous were physically removed from the building as police fire tear gas and water cannon to disperse thousands of demonstrators Hardenberg can police tightened security outside the Istanbul office is this the crowd continued to protest one of them said seizure of the newspaper it was tyranny unions fear in the villains in your pajamas nobody can impact of such a cruel measuring any part of the world where in the world if you seen this tear any before this didn\u0027t happen even when Hitler was in power let alone Turkey even the incidents going on in Syria not this much better Christmas wreath good so you son is in many settlements indebted and we\u0027re all humans after all and every human being matches different opinion should be voiced in a society that\u0027s my opinion a single voice does not mean anything therefore we came here to show different voices and to support salmon newspaper we are sorry this is not the country we are longing for we are concerned I stayed to the Financial Times added set in stumble mojo shifts tostada who told me that the we can take a vote was expected this was a crackdown that had been expected for quite some time drugs government admitted very clear president era wanted me to very clear that he was unhappy with newspapers like someone that he ties to a Islamic imam who lives in Pennsylvania and is now considered a sworn enemy of the president Osmond\u0027s bosses who had interviewed three months ago I\u0027m story warning about this were very clear this is gonna happen to them do you think the urgency railway out with how you leaders want to resolve the migrant crisis is meaning that\u0027s perhaps are taking a softer stance against encore than they otherwise would undoubtedly it\u0027s been very clear to Turkish officials that this is a time when the European needs it the most and they have been back paddling being softer even ignoring some of the excesses you seen in Turkey and there was a report that the European Union was was released in October which would be critical of the way that the Turkish judiciary has been behaving the way the church government has been overstepping its bounds in that report was delayed until after November elections that\u0027s something that came up in conversation between senior EU officials and the president as a reminder that they were also bending over backwards to stop any outside criticism from affecting his electoral prospects however the German foreign minister has said said today that they will be bringing up this issue of with that Turkey\u0027s prime minister during those talks and they are taking this seriously they will take it seriously into the bringing it up and talks but as a couple of Turkish officials and selecting dimmer Taj you drove the big Kurdish party here\u0027s HTP have told me Turkey has a Europe over a barrel right now the overwhelming politically Xing your right now is a refugee crisis and the only way to get those numbers down strike a deal Turkey Turkish officials understand that joining the European Union is a long and complicated process but right now you can get concessions that they need which includes billions of euros to help them pay for the cost of taking care of some two point seven million refugees and Turkey visa free travel for Turkey\u0027s our citizens to the European Union and to some extent perhaps a get out of jail free card for some of these actions that have taken among the colleagues that you work with and those other publications in Turkey is that a real sense of unease at the moment with some on one has to remember is that it saved far more complicated issue than just press freedom as a newspaper that has been aligned with the group that\u0027s involved in a political and a long running dispute with the government and previously was very loyal to the government they had a falling out in the middle of the little twenty thirteen but this other newspapers including one Kalju ingredients which means Republic it\u0027s incredibly old newspapers very well respected and the two editors of the newspaper had been jailed for over ninety days while awaiting trial and that wasn\u0027t who she used to stop off from the Financial Times in Istanbul China faces a difficult battle ahead the words of premier Li cho Chang at the nation\u0027s annual parliamentary me sing the national people\u0027s Congress which began on Saturday Beijing is lowered its growth will cost a six and a half percent for the coming year and it faces some tough questions overt stewardship of the world\u0027s second largest economy and its financial markets if the average Chinese person does what the government has to say I have any impacts when a reporter Danny Vincent was outside the Congress anti today I\u0027m standing on the corner of charm and having you in central Beijing across the road I can see the people\u0027s Congress building it\u0027s China\u0027s parliament when legislators meet just once a year inside is a celebration of Chinese democracy sorts more than three thousand delegates sits in these wide holes setting the agenda on the nation\u0027s policies but it\u0027s often seen as a rubber stamp parliament decisions in China a made behind closed doors well ok you don\u0027t have a lot in the tiny street on the outskirts of Beijing stands a small open markets surrounded by skyscrapers and scaffolding traders listen to nationalistic pop music while sending their goods China is changing all around them here business over the last few months has been slowing nearby magma in the savings and unemployment business isn\u0027t so great but the standard of living is definitely better than it once was the food retailer clothes we wear are definitely better than before I think that what the delegates presented strong Chinese parliament will be good for ordinary people the traders here Olczyk memorial and patriotic this is what the Communist Party because capitalism with Chinese characteristics adequate amounts of was a muzzle on the ground them dollar hundred students whatever direction the Chinese Communist Party points is to we follow it whatever the Chinese Communist Party does must be correct it has been years since mounts a doomed one as this country we just want to make a living if we can eat well and drinkwell with satisfied sitting in a chair unknown watching his school is Mr pan a pensioner who fully supports the policies of the Communist Party so ruin your question that should they mean that they are so similar Cuba after the thirteen five year plan everyone in China should be able to live a wealthy life like the small business last year oil and thirty thousand dollars it\u0027s good will my children work the state owned companies life is getting better observers say the Chinese economy is overt you a change so it must move away from its reliance on exports and manufacturing but it must also keep up with huge expectations from Chinese people and the rest of the world when it was done even supposing that to meet the new growth figures the five year plan being unveiled at the Congress includes targets on energy consumption job creation and inflation but analysts say details are pretty sketchy and there\u0027s a promise to overhaul the bloated state sector by bringing in the private companies to help run station films that dominate industries across banking telecoms oil and stale not Williams\u0027s chief Asia economist with capital economics I asked him how hard the target of six and a half percent will be to achieve I think it\u0027s very unlikely that in reality China will grow anything like the six Nov seven percent target the government has said himself I think most analysts of China\u0027s economy will tell you that last year for example the economy didn\u0027t grow as fast as the government said it it there\u0027s a gap between I think what\u0027s happening on the ground and what the government says is happening in in its figures unfortunate because they continue to set his high growth targets that cap I think will assist the country\u0027s chief economic planner has said that China won\u0027t experience a hard landing do you think that\u0027s possible given thus says the authorities opposes that they\u0027ve really got it popped out on these zombie firm somebody takeout all this up over capacity how will the economy be able to cope with that well etcetera very difficult transition lies ahead over the next few years as you say there\u0027s a lot of companies that are not making any money that they they need to be closed down workers later he moved to other parts of the economy but I think it is possible for that to happen without there being a hard landing because Chinese policymakers unlike many in the west for example still have quite a lot of room to stimulate their economy to can cut interest rates further they can loosen fiscal policy and in fact that\u0027s where public agency of the next few months I was safe with a message recall from Beijing this weekend now you touch tone fiscal policy a little earlier because I the authorities have said that we\u0027re going to earmark money to fund tax cuts do you think this is more evidence of this continued shift towards more consumption and thus saving here this is a positive developments I have the past few years normally when the Chinese government was to stimulate to monitor spot to say by trying to stimulate more investment get the bank\u0027s lending more and so on and not says has fueled this issue of over investment that we see throughout the economy yeah estrogen is more based on tax cuts I think could be very effective typically if those tax cuts go to poorer households people were more likely to spend a lot of money that could do a lot said to Bustamante mutt Williams from capital economics let\u0027s check in now with the financial markets have we can speak to Jamie that same call from stockbrokers Charleston is with me now I know that Jarod said what impact his will Beijing being sang had only will price well it\u0027s very hard to suit entangle our ports been going on with your price which is essentially frankly being driven by very aggressive show covering by which I mean speculators who had previously sold exposure are in anticipation of the price would go down a now covering that bets on this is causing uninterested squeeze in the price which is driving it higher so that\u0027s what\u0027s happening does it bear any relation to what\u0027s happening in the real world as the reports are quite brightly certain you requesting to can China achieve that six to help Simpson growth rate highly debatable not survive Chinese economist from becoming somewhat less than that there is some scope for fiscal policy easing as well as mum triple seizing what about the world economy his to be teetering on the edge of a global recession and there is still the substantial supply demand did secular print that exists and has not yet been addressed for all the talk we can recounts about production cuts as time with oil shall we had today\u0027s pays off its historical debts to the national Iranian oil company which seem to be hampering there comes a time to get back into the country how significant is this do you thing I think is extremely significant Sir this is a residual one point seven seven billion euros a one point four billion pounds it relates to previous unpaid deliveries of oil service money that shell has owned the effects of the Iranian government for quite sometime escorted out the way it\u0027s got out the way very quickly and therefore in what will doubtless be a race to participate in the rebuilding of Iranian infrastructure I\u0027m sure so would like to play a key policy not and just very briefly let\u0027s talk about EDF the French energy giant it Sam Shepard\u0027s has fallen over the resignation it\u0027s fun lunch finance officers chief financial officer was this is all about said the costs of further developing Hinkley point these are some set nuclear power station I which is going to cost the ETF very substantial amounts of money is going to have to raise death you know it\u0027s to do this essentially under the very bottom line he has resigned over government policy which said remains in relation to that first generation and to the utilities sector jamboree somewhat unusual interesting academies bats account many thanks said the latest numbers for you in London the one hundred share index is down point three percent at sixty one eighty two and in New York the Dow is up point three percent seventeen thousand and fifty five you\u0027re listening to well business report from the BBC world service still to come DC Callaway tells us about the office pranks of her friends he had to wear a red to draw under a white shut the office the next day and then take off his jacket during a client meeting and why Morton corporate culture now frowns at practical joke it\u0027s limbo time in Spain in more ways than one it\u0027s two months since the election but still no government is being formed and now the bar is set for another deadline Spain\u0027s political parties will have two months more to form a new administration otherwise fresh elections we cooled guy has got reports now on the deadlock from Madrid a lot of them got me that\u0027ll be interpreting that you know what hundred thirty one votes in favor and two hundred nineteen against a resounding defeat editor Sanchez and the first time in Spain\u0027s democratic era the candidate for prime minister has lost this parliamentary because vote the ramifications a headline news in Spain this is also the first time Spain has had such a fragmented parliament the arrival of two relatively new parties podamos and sue that analysts have shaken up an electoral system that had been dominated by the socialists and the conservative popular party for more than three decades Mister Sanchez formed a pact with the liberal Susanna\u0027s party but that wasn\u0027t enough to win the fight no party came even close to getting a majority in the election meaning power and now essential out here on the streets of Madrid people seem to have a mixed opinion about all this the two main parties that we had in Spain it during the last ten years have stolen a lot of money from the population so I think it\u0027s positive to have two new parties I think it\u0027s great that we have new parties because people are more efficiency parties themselves have been quick to blame each other for the deadlock in January marry under a hallway the popular party\u0027s prime minister rejected king Phillip has invitation to try to form a new government saying he didn\u0027t have enough support in parliament despite winning the most number of votes cast by the public it\u0027s popular party wanted to form a so called grand coalition with the socialists and silanis but Mister hoy has become increasingly isolated in recent weeks Kuralt by corruption scandals apparently without any potential governing partners whole ceremony Garcia and then this is a member of parliament for the popular party the uncertainty and then next ability coming out of the process course poses several questions on the economy and that\u0027s what we are trying to push the sausage before these precognition and that\u0027s why we made such a generous offer some of the other opposition parties have said that\u0027s the problem hail a problem here is Marianna Hoyt a prime minister and he should step down not woods perhaps help the situation do you think you\u0027re the leader of your party should step down all that might make things easier not at all and from our side that we said that the problem that way perasaan to the leader of the Socialist Party although he could have been part of the solution keys the problem hockey\u0027s yes Putina a blockade on the whole situation but see that analysts which ones to modernize the economy and clamp down on corruption see Siniora hallway is anything but the solution Antonio roll down is the party spokesman on economic affairs I don\u0027t think that directoy can actually you you\u0027re going to be ambitious you going to be really committed to this change and that only the political party of Mister hoy the popular party has huge felons interpretive corruptions the entire thing we can support the holy as a leading fee if you go to to these big transition that we expect to have in this country if there is no government by early may fresh elections will be called meanwhile the until Sterrett he pulled animals says it wants to form a coalition of the left with the socialists and other small a leftist parties pull them as his fiery leader properly list yes says he cannot work with ciudadanos he says has neo liberal economic policies last year Mister Iglesias gave king Felipe it as a gift a box set of game of thrones TV show full of political intrigue trail suggesting the monarch might learn something from it with Spain\u0027s political scene frozen by lack of consensus he might be right so I hedge Carol forcing that you\u0027re listening to the BBC world service the world\u0027s radio station and it\u0027s a special good evening to our listeners on digital short wave of DRM in India and five point eight four five megahertz hi yeah Khalil fashioned not never said this ten years ago but when a long chassis email pains into my inbox it\u0027s now quite quite in an era when life changing moments I shared on social media long and detailed updates via email to become few and far between despite the competition amazed offices that and a treatment is still the way to do business it\u0027s injuring legacy for its inventor American ray Tomlinson who\u0027s died aged seventy four he\u0027s credited with putting the sign in the addresses of the revolutionary system back in nineteen seventy one Heraeus speaking on national public radio\u0027s All Things Considered program in nineteen seventy one I was busily trying to find things to use this new fangled network for I heard about a proposal to send messages to be printed with the printer and stuffed away in mailboxes for people to read and I said these messages should go to computers and so I thought about it for a bit and then decided to put together a system that might do that and so you you were just kind of doing this on your own nobody said Hey at ray can you invent a email in the statement of work did not say thou shall go go forth and invent email but we were working on ways to which humans and computers could interact and try to improve that interaction do you remember what your first email said well everybody asks that course I don\u0027t remember every single word of it the main thing is there were lots of test messages here these things don\u0027t work out of the box because there was no box every time you test you have to generate some kind of a message and you might drag your fingers across the keyboard or just type the opening phrase from Lincoln\u0027s Gettysburg address or something else so technically the first email is completely forgettable and therefore forgotten footage your first message go to all the text messages were sent to myself I had to computers that were literally side by side keyboards are about ten feet apart and I could wheel my chair from one to the other type a message and one and then go to the other and see what I tried to send now why did you pick the Exxon this iconic symbol hadn\u0027t you pick that simple you know certainly wasn\u0027t an icon back in nineteen seventy one but it was a key on the keyboard that did not appear in users names not appear and host names it made sense it\u0027s off the proposition it means user apt post that is the only proposition on the keyboard so did you become a internet billionaire from us no I do not a billionaire today not not by several more hours a magnitude hundreds hundreds of millions know I\u0027ve often thought about what fraction of a cent per at side would it take to make me very comfortable and this is not is a very small fraction so ray Tomlinson I do you feel comfortable with the title ray Tomlinson inventor of email yeah you can call me that and that\u0027s ray Tomlinson inventor of the email who died on Saturday aged seventy four now how many giggles do you get through journey average working day laughter in the office is apparently becoming a serious business on regular commentator DC carried the Financial Times says office pranks allow a rat breach in an era of political correctness Evita the other day a journalist colleague told me how recently he had sneaked up to a work mates unattended computer and fires off a message to the man\u0027s male boss that sad I can contain my feelings for you no longer what struck me most about this story was not baby Ashton us but that such behavior has become an anachronism how do you anyone plays pranks like this at work anymore my generation used the thrive on such things but is mostly grown out of them I colleague accepted well the younger generation has failed to grow into them and acquaintances upon us a little fun tells me that young lawyers areas prank phobic as young Janice the source of JP and his peers engaged and his associates in the nineteen nineties and now inconceivable he\u0027d tell me how he once lost a bet with another lawyer as a result of which he had to wear a red raw under a white check to the office the next day and then take off his jacket during a client meeting last week I hunted down some of the graduate trainees who have been at the Financial Times for a year or so how many practical jets and they played all had sprung on them what kind of cost not only was the onset none but they appear not to understand the question is this some fashion to pranks that defines millennials far more than any of their other suppose it characteristics and it\u0027s easy to understand why they feel if they do for stars employers have made all of us more politically correct normal rule bound and more faint stand by five hundred page codes of conduct more than corporate culture takes a dim view of pranks seeing them as bullying or is harassment more than most young people of land that there\u0027s no such thing as a private joke on email only idiotic old people think there is and then life is becomes a much more competitive my generation slipped into jobs and never felt any particular need to behave in a professional fashion except when strictly cold full by contrast any twenty five year old he\u0027s made it into a big corporate job has hacked to excel academically climb Kilimanjaro start a couple of charities place semi professional viola and have taught themselves how to because it baby ish pranks simply don\u0027t fit the profile get the most powerful reason is that young professionals do not think it\u0027s okay to pretend to be someone else online one of them explained to me that that internet personas as so much a part of them the whole lives are online then it counts is a serious betrayal if anyone especially a colleague tries to mess with that still the death of the prank strikes me as a terrible shame office work is relentless and I just look at someone else\u0027s expense can share one out now and great pranks does want bullies they knew how to do it with just enough affection that even the victim wasn\u0027t Scott for very long when I was new at the FDA in nineteen eighty five one colleague and particularly used to delight and phoning me from the other side of an open plan office pretending to be an enraged chief executive from the company I\u0027d written about complaining that my article was full of mistakes I would start her own blush my colleague and his friends would waltz vastly amused alright mortified I eventually saw the funny side I repaid the pranks that by marrying him our fun loving correspondent Lucy Callaway from the Financial Times and if you still love pranks at work tell us about them by emailing us thanks ray Tomlinson the address is well thought business at BBC dot co dot UK but if that\u0027s too old fashioned contact us on Twitter at BBC well bears or me Sousa\u0027s Theresa from all of us here goodbye there are many ways to keep up with the BBC world service join us on social
